Common ,06.15.2017,"The Eurogroup welcomes that agreement has been reached between Greece and the institutions on a policy package of structural measures, which aims at shoring up growth and addressing the underlying structural imbalances in public finances and paves the way for a successful completion of the second review of the ESM programme.
The Eurogroup also welcomes the adoption by the Greek parliament of the agreed prior actions for the second review, notably the ambitious post-programme fiscal package, which is composed of an income tax reform broadening the tax base and a pension reform. Together they deliver net savings of 2% of GDP which will underpin the fiscal targets post-2018. It also contains a contingent expansionary package to enhance the growth potential of the Greek economy and to improve the Greek social safety net that will be implemented provided that the agreed medium-term targets are met. We also welcome the adoption of a package of decisive measures to effectively address non-performing loans (NPL), such as establishing an active secondary market, an Out-of-Court Debt Workout framework, as well as all actions to make the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) fully operational.
Moreover, the policy package includes a large number of structural measures aimed at enhancing the growth potential of the Greek economy. With regard to labour market reforms, the Eurogroup welcomes the adopted legislation safeguarding previous reforms on collective bargaining and bringing collective dismissals in line with best EU practices. The Eurogroup also commends the Greek authorities for adopting legislation to implement OECD recommendations to strengthen competition, to facilitate investment licensing and to further open-up regulated professions. We welcome the commitment by Greece to continue on its reform path.
The Eurogroup also commends Greece and the European Commission for the exceptional mobilisation of EU Funds to boost investment in support of jobs and growth since July 2015, for a total amount of nearly EUR 11 bn. The Eurogroup calls upon the Greek authorities to work closely with the European Commission to ensure that additional EUR 970 million made available following the review of the national cohesion policy funding envelopes for the period from 2017 - 2020 are fully absorbed. Furthermore, we commit to continue to provide high-level experts to support the design and implementation of reforms through technical assistance projects.
In parallel the Eurogroup invites Greece together with the institutions as well as relevant third parties by the end of this year to develop and support a holistic growth enhancing strategy including improvements of the investment climate. Further options for mobilizing additional funds from national development banks and other international financial institutions (such as the EIB and EBRD) should be explored. 
The Eurogroup supports the efforts of the Greek authorities to work with the European institutions on the creation of a National Development Bank that would coordinate the implementation of development and promotional activities. The Eurogroup calls upon Greece, the European Commission and IFIs to work together to strengthen the pipelines of viable investment projects. Efforts should be made to step up the technical assistance from the European Investment Advisory Hub with a view to facilitating the preparation of investable projects and the establishment of investment platforms.
Today the Eurogroup discussed again the sustainability of Greek public debt with the objective that Greece regains market access at sustainable rates. The Eurogroup reconfirmed the commitments and principles contained in the statements of May 2016. We noted that the implementation of the agreed short term debt measures already contributes to a substantial lowering of the gross financing needs (GFN) of Greece over the medium and long term and significantly improves the profile of Greek public debt.
The Eurogroup welcomes the commitment of Greece to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and thereafter a fiscal trajectory that is consistent with its commitments under the European fiscal framework, which would be achieved according to the analysis of the European Commission with a primary surplus of equal to or above but close to 2% of GDP in the period from 2023 to 2060.
The Eurogroup concluded that debt sustainability should be attained within the framework of the debt measures envisaged by the Eurogroup in May 2016. In this regard, the Eurogroup recalled the assessment of debt sustainability with reference to the agreed benchmarks for gross financing needs: GFN should remain below 15% of GDP in the medium term and below 20% of GDP thereafter so as to ensure that debt remains on a sustained downward path.
The Eurogroup recalls that it stands ready to implement a second set of debt measures to the extent needed to meet the aforementioned GFN objectives, in line with the Eurogroup statement of 25 May 2016. This includes abolishing the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme, the use of 2014 SMP profits from the ESM segregated account, the restoration of the transfer of the equivalent of ANFA and SMP profits to Greece (as of budget year 2017), liability management operations within the current ESM programme envelope taking due account of the exceptionally high burden of some Member States, and EFSF re-profiling within the maximum Programme Authorised Amount.
The Eurogroup stands ready to implement, without prejudice to the final DSA, extensions of the weighted average maturities (WAM) and a further deferral of EFSF interest and amortization by between 0 and 15 years. As agreed in May 2016, these measures shall not lead to additional costs for other beneficiary Member States.
In order to take into account possible differences between growth assumptions in the DSA and actual growth developments over the post-programme period, the EFSF re-profiling would be recalibrated according to an operational growth-adjustment mechanism to be agreed. This mechanism will be fully specified as part of the medium-term debt relief measures, following the successful implementation of the ESM programme to make sure the GFN benchmarks defined above are respected and to ensure that the ceiling established by the EFSF Programme Authorised Amount is respected. The Eurogroup mandates the EWG to work further on this as of 2018.
At the end of the programme, conditional upon its successful implementation and to the extent necessary, this second set of measures will be implemented. The exact calibration of these measures will be confirmed at the end of the programme by the Eurogroup on the basis of an updated DSA in cooperation with the European institutions, so as to ensure debt sustainability and compliance with the European fiscal policy framework. This DSA, while based on cautious assumptions, will also take into account the impact of growth enhancing reforms and investment initiatives.
For the long term, the Eurogroup recalls the May 2016 agreement that in the case of an unexpectedly more adverse scenario a contingency mechanism on debt could be activated. The activation of this mechanism would be considered subject to a decision by the Eurogroup and could entail measures such as a further EFSF re-profiling and capping and deferral of interest payments.
Acknowledging the staff level agreement reached with Greece on policies, IMF management will shortly recommend to the IMF's Executive Board the approval in principle of Greece's request for a 14-month  Standby Arrangement.  The IMF welcomes the further specification of the debt measures given today by Member States, and agrees that it represents a major step towards Greek debt sustainability. The IMF arrangement will become effective with resources made available in accordance with its terms, provided that the programme stays on track, when IMF staff can assure to the IMF's Executive Board that there is an agreement on debt relief measures, that, appropriately calibrated at the end of the programme, would secure debt sustainability.
In view of the full implementation of all prior actions and subject to the completion of national procedures, the ESM governing bodies are expected to approve the supplemental MoU and the disbursement of the third tranche of the ESM programme amounting to EUR 8.5 bn to cover current financing needs, arrears clearing, and possibly room to start building up a cash buffer.
In view of the ending of the current programme in August 2018, the Eurogroup commits to provide support for Greece's return to the market: the Eurogroup agrees that future disbursements should cater not only for the need to clear arrears but also to further build up cash buffers to support investor's confidence and facilitate market access.

Common ,04.01.2014,"Eurogroup Statement on Greece 
The Eurogroup welcomes the conclusion of the fourth review mission under the second macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece. The Eurogroup reiterates its appreciation for the efforts made by the Greek citizens and notes with satisfaction that the fiscal performance is on track to exceed the programme targets in 2013 and meet them in 2014, allowing Greece to provide additional financing for debt servicing and to undertake some one-off spending in 2014 to bolster social cohesion. Good progress is also being made on structural reforms. 
At the same time, the reform process will have to continue in order to enhance the growth potential of the Greek economy by creating job opportunities and a healthy investment environment. In this context, the Eurogroup welcomes the authorities' strong commitment to the implementation of a wide range of product (goods and services) market and institutional reforms. Concrete measures to liberalise transport and rental markets and to open up closed professions are being prepared. Bold and frontloaded cuts in social security contributions are expected to improve competitiveness and boost growth. In addition, the authorities have committed to far-reaching energy market reforms and to enhancing the privatisation of public corporate and real estate assets, which would provide financing to the government while unlocking private investment. It is also important that continued progress is made in the area of public administration reforms, in order to improve the quality and efficiency of the services that the public sector provides to its citizens, as well as with labour market reforms. 
The Eurogroup acknowledges the actions and commitments of the authorities to ensure the resilience of the banking sector, which will support the economic recovery. Following the publication of the Bank of Greece's supervisory stress test and asset quality review, two of the four core banks have already successfully raised more than the capital required by the supervisor (under the baseline scenario) fully from private investors. This is an encouraging sign of improving market confidence. We now expect that also the remaining two core banks will raise their capital needs swiftly first and foremost from private investors. 
The Eurogroup considers that the necessary elements are now in place to launch national procedures with a view to pave the way for the approval of the next EFSF instalment of EUR 8.3 billion. The instalment is foreseen to be disbursed in three tranches. A first tranche of EUR 6.3 billion is expected to be approved by the EWG and the EFSF's Board of Directors, following the full implementation of the prior actions and finalisation of Member States' relevant national procedures. The disbursements of the second and the third tranches, amounting to EUR 1 billion each, are linked to the implementation of milestones agreed between Greece and the Troika institutions. 
The programme is fully financed for the next 12 months, including by drawing on temporary sources of financing such as deposits of general government subsectors. Euro area Member States recall their commitment to provide adequate support until Greece regains market access, provided Greece fully complies with the requirements and objectives of the adjustment programme. This will be further addressed in the context of the next review.

Common ,05.05.2014,"Eurogroup statement on Greece 
5.05.2014 
The Eurogroup welcomes the recent positive macroeconomic developments in the Greek economy. The renewed growth prospects for Greece reflect the remarkable adjustment efforts undertaken by the Greek citizens and authorities. The economic adjustment programme is starting to pay off and is proving to be a cornerstone for Greece's return to sustainable and balanced growth. Fiscal performance continues to be strong, as reflected in the primary surplus for 2013 as defined in the programme. Moreover, the recent return of the Hellenic Republic and of Greek banks to the international capital markets is an encouraging sign of increasing market confidence and is an important first step towards regaining broader market access. Fully implementing the reforms of the programme will be crucial to that end. 
We further welcome that the Greek authorities have complied with the prior actions required for the first EFSF disbursement of the current review. The EFSF Board of Directors approved the disbursement of EUR 6.3 billion, which took place on 28 April. The IMF Executive Board is foreseen to decide in June on the IMF disbursement of around EUR 3.6 billion linked to the review. We call on the authorities to carry the current positive reform momentum forward to maintain the programme on track and avoid accumulating delays. 
As foreseen under the programme, the significant adjustment made allows the Greek economy to enter now a new phase, moving from stabilisation and recovery to sustainable growth. The long-term strategy to foster growth presented to us by the Greek authorities shows a clear ownership and determination to continue the reform path. The Eurogroup supports this strategy that builds on the adjustment programme by stepping up policies that raise private investment, facilitate economic activity and eventually lead to more job creation. We invite Greece to develop a more detailed action plan consistent with the existing programme. 
Against this background, the Eurogroup welcomes the progress made by the European Commission and the Greek authorities with the preparation of the Partnership Agreement for the European Structural and Investment Funds. In the next seven years, these funds will provide around EUR 19 
billion of co-financing transfers for the Greek economy with the aim to create a competitive, dynamic and inclusive economy, driven by entrepreneurship and innovation. Moreover, the Greek government has expressed the ambition to attract and facilitate private investment. In this context, the recently established Institution for Growth will help to pool financial resources from private and public organisations to provide financing to SMEs and for public investment projects. 
The Eurogroup also welcomes the contribution to programme implementation provided by technical assistance to Greece under the coordination of the Task Force for Greece (TFGR). We stress the need for a continuation and stepping up of technical assistance in support of growth-related reforms (including via fighting tax evasion and corruption and supporting capacity building of national public administration). Euro area Member States will assess their possibilities for getting into closer 
1 
partnerships with Greece in this regard. We encourage Greece to make use of the new funding arrangement for technical assistance beyond 2014. We recommend Greece, in coordination with the Commission (including the Task Force for Greece) to provide an overview of external financing and technical support available and to reflect on the potential role of relevant international financial institutions in providing their expertise and, where applicable, funds. 
Euro area Member States reaffirm their commitment to provide adequate support until Greece regains full market access, provided Greece fully complies with the requirements and objectives of the adjustment programme. The relative merits of possible debt sustainability measures, as stated by the Eurogroup on 27 November 2012, will be considered in the context of the next review.

Common ,12.08.2014,"The Eurogroup welcomes the recent positive macroeconomic developments in the Greek economy. The improving growth prospects for Greece reflect the remarkable adjustment efforts undertaken by the Greek citizens and authorities. The economic adjustment programme is starting to pay off and is proving to be a cornerstone for Greece's return to sustainable and balanced growth and job creation. 
We also welcome the progress made by the Greek authorities in order to address the outstanding issues to conclude the fifth review, as assessed by the European Commission (EC), the ECB and the IMF. However we take note that despite this recent progress the current review can no longer be completed before the end of year. Therefore, the current review will need to continue into early 2015 until the staff-level agreement is reached and all the prior actions are deemed to be fulfilled. This would pave the way for the disbursement of the EUR 1.8 billion outstanding under the current EFSF programme. 
Therefore, the Eurogroup would be favourably disposed to a request by Greece for a technical extension of 2 months of the current EFSF programme. The Eurogroup asked the institutions to prepare a factual report on the state of play of the current review and gave a mandate to the EWG to report to Member States in order to launch the national procedures with a view to reach a final decision on the extension of the current EFSF Master Financial Facility Agreement by the EFSF Board of Directors by the end of the year. 
Moreover, we were informed by the EC, the ECB and the IMF that it would be prudent to extend the availability period of the EFSF bonds in the HFSF buffer until the end of February 2015, in parallel to the extension of the EFSF programme. The Eurogroup looks favourably at such an extension. Following a request by Greece, the EFSF can make the necessary arrangements before the end of the year. 
The Eurogroup urges the Greek authorities to ensure a rapid and full implementation of all the reform measures necessary to conclude the fifth review. These reforms are key for the smooth functioning of the Greek economy and will contribute to bringing about sustained growth and employment and to secure the sustainability of public finances, thereby fully delivering on the programme objectives. 
Euro area Member States remain favourably disposed to granting Greece an ESM precautionary credit line (ECCL), if Greece were to request this and subject to the finalisation of the reform measures that are still pending under the current review, continued involvement of the IMF, and the completion of relevant national and EU procedures.

Eurozone finance ministers met to discuss the way forward for Greece in the context of the upcoming expiry of the country's current economic adjustment programme. The discussions were based on the technical work carried out over the past few days, setting out the differences between the current programme and the plans of the Greek government. 


""The best way forward is an extension of the current programme"", said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Eurogroup President at the press conference following the meeting. He went on to highlight that there was a degree of flexibility within the programme, which could be negotiated between Greece and the institutions. 
These negotiations could start when the Greek authorities submit a request for an extension of the programme accompanied by a clear set of commitments outlined by the ministers during the meeting.

During the last few weeks, we have, together with the institutions, engaged in an intensive and constructive dialogue with the new Greek authorities and reached common ground today. 
The Eurogroup notes, in the framework of the existing arrangement, the request from the Greek authorities for an extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (MFFA), which is underpinned by a set of commitments. The purpose of the extension is the successful completion of the review on the basis of the conditions in the current arrangement, making best use of the given flexibility which will be considered jointly with the Greek authorities and the institutions. This extension would also bridge the time for discussions on a possible follow-up arrangement between the Eurogroup, the institutions and Greece. 
The Greek authorities will present a first list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, by the end of Monday February 23. The institutions will provide a first view whether this is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review. This list will be further specified and then agreed with the institutions by the end of April.  
Only approval of the conclusion of the review of the extended arrangement by the institutions in turn will allow for any disbursement of the outstanding tranche of the current EFSF programme and the transfer of the 2014 SMP profits. Both are again subject to approval by the Eurogroup. 
In view of the assessment of the institutions the Eurogroup agrees that the funds, so far available in the HFSF buffer, should be held by the EFSF, free of third party rights for the duration of the MFFA extension. The funds continue to be available for the duration of the MFFA extension and can only be used for bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. They will only be released on request by the ECB/SSM. 
In this light, we welcome the commitment by the Greek authorities to work in close agreement with European and international institutions and partners. Against this background we recall the independence of the European Central Bank. We also agreed that the IMF would continue to play its role. 
The Greek authorities have expressed their strong commitment to a broader and deeper structural reform process aimed at durably improving growth and employment prospects, ensuring stability and resilience of the financial sector and enhancing social fairness. The authorities commit to implementing long overdue reforms to tackle corruption and tax evasion, and improving the efficiency of the public sector. In this context, the Greek authorities undertake to make best use of the continued provision of technical assistance. 
The Greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely. 
The Greek authorities have also committed to ensure the appropriate primary fiscal surpluses or financing proceeds required to guarantee debt sustainability in line with the November 2012 Eurogroup statement. The institutions will, for the 2015 primary surplus target, take the economic circumstances in 2015 into account. 
In light of these commitments, we welcome that in a number of areas the Greek policy priorities can contribute to a strengthening and better implementation of the current arrangement. The Greek authorities commit to refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions. 
On the basis of the request, the commitments by the Greek authorities, the advice of the institutions, and today's agreement, we will launch the national procedures with a view to reaching a final decision on the extension of the current EFSF Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement for up to four months by the EFSF Board of Directors. We also invite the institutions and the Greek authorities to resume immediately the work that would allow the successful conclusion of the review.

Common ,07.13.2015,"Ministers held a follow-up discussion on the agreement negotiated at the Eurogroup and the Euro Summit over the previous two days following the request by Greece for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism, which had been submitted on 9 July 2015.

On 13 July the euro-area leaders agreed on a set of measures to be implemented before formal negotiations on a new ESM programme can begin.
Next steps
The President outlined the next steps that are expected to be taken in line with the agreement:
By Wednesday (15 July) Greece is expected to implement the first set of measures outlined in the Euro Summit statement
Then the national procedures  necessary to authorise the start of negotiations on the programme would begin
Following the completion of the national procedures, the Eurogroup would be in a position to give the institutions a mandate to start negotiations with the Greek authorities on a new Memorandum of Understanding
In parallel with the negotiations, the Greek authorities would continue implementing the agreed measures
The final formal decision on the ESM programme would then be taken.

Common ,08.14.2015,"The Eurogroup welcomes the agreement that has been reached between Greece and the European Institutions, with input from the IMF, on the policy conditionality underlying the new ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme. The Eurogroup commends the Greek authorities for their demonstrated strong commitment as shown by the normalisation of the working methods with the Institutions and the conduct of the negotiations in a determined and swift manner. This agreement is in line with the parameters and key objectives set by the Euro summit on 12 July and provides a comprehensive framework for restoring the Greek economy to a sustainable path. 
The Eurogroup welcomes the wide scope of the policy meaThe Eurogroup was informed about the latest developments in Greece.
It is confident that the new government, which will be formed after the general elections later this month, will work constructively with its euro area partners and the institutions to implement Greece's new economic adjustment programme, agreed in August.
sures contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which, if implemented with determination, will address the main challenges facing the Greek economy. We are confident that decisive and as swift as possible implementation of the reform measures as spelled out in the MoU will allow the Greek economy to return to a sustainable growth path based on sound public finances, enhanced competitiveness, high employment and financial stability. 
Greece will target a medium-term primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP  with a fiscal path of primary balances of -0.25% in 2015, 0.5% in 2016, 1.75% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018 to be achieved notably through upfront parametric fiscal reforms supported by measures to strengthen tax compliance and fight tax evasion. Greece will undertake an ambitious reform of the pension system aimed at ensuring its sustainability, efficiency and fairness. It will specify policies to fully compensate for the fiscal impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on the 2012 pension reform and to implement the zero deficit clause or mutually agreeable alternative measures by October 2015. Greece has furthermore committed to key labour and product market reforms to open up the economy to investment and competition, as well as to modernise and depoliticise the public sector. With regard to the financial sector, Greece has committed to take decisive measures to safeguard stability, including a recapitalisation of the banks as required, measures to enhance the insolvency framework and a significant improvement of the governance of the banks and the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). Following the results of the Asset Quality Review and Stress Tests before the end of the year, the bail in instrument will apply for senior debt bondholders whereas bail in of depositors is excluded. The Eurogroup stresses that the agreed conditionality needs to be further specified as requested by the IMF a matter of priority, in particular in the areas of pension reforms and financial sector strategy and governance, in agreement with the three Institutions in time for the completion of the first review under the ESM programme. Moreover, Greece will take urgently needed steps to tackle the non-performing loan (NPL) problem in the banking sector. Given the magnitude of the problem, we urge the authorities to develop all necessary instruments to that end, including opening the market for NPL servicing and disposal with the appropriate safeguards to protect vulnerable debtors and exploring the possibility of a bad bank. 
Compliance with the conditionality of the MoU will be monitored by the Commission in liaison with the ECB and together with the IMF, as foreseen in Article 13(7) of the ESM Treaty. 
The Eurogroup stresses that a significantly strengthened privatisation programme is a cornerstone of the new ESM programme. The Eurogroup welcomes the Greek authorities' commitment to adopt new legislation to ensure transparent privatisation procedures and adequate asset sale pricing, according to OECD principles and standards on the management of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). To ensure a more ambitious privatisation process, an independent fund will be established in Greece under the supervision of the relevant European institutions by end-2015 and encompass the privatisation of independently valuated state assets, while avoiding fire sales. The Eurogroup expects the Greek government to endorse the plan for this fund by the end of October 2015 so that it can be operational by the end of the year. Its task will be to quickly identify, transfer over the lifetime of the programme, and manage valuable Greek assets through privatisation and other means, including minority shareholdings and to increase their value on a professional basis. This will include the shares in Greek banks after their recapitalisation, thus also enhancing banks' governance. This should ensure that a targeted value of EUR 50 bn can be realised, by putting the assets on the market, of which EUR 25bn will be used for the repayment of recapitalization of banks and other assets and 50 % of every remaining euro (i.e. 50% of EUR 25bn) will be used for decreasing the debt to GDP ratio and the remaining 50 % will be used for investments. The legislation to establish the Fund shall be adopted in agreement with European institutions. 
The Eurogroup appreciates that the Greek authorities have taken additional important legislative steps over the last few days. This supports the gradual process of rebuilding trust, demonstrating the authorities policy resolve and programme ownership. Those steps include notably additional fiscal measures on the tax and expenditure side, legislation on early retirement as well as an extensive set of actions in relation to the financial sector and product markets. In addition, in line with the Eurogroup statement of 16 July, the Greek authorities took measures to adjust and complete the legislation adopted on 15 July 2015. The authorities have also repealed a number of provisions backtracking on previous programme commitments. 
The Eurogroup welcomes that the implementation of those prior actions has been assessed positively by the Institutions. The Greek authorities have confirmed their intention to complete by September the follow up actions identified by the Institutions, including the need to bring the adopted household insolvency law in line with the proposal of the Institutions. 
Based on the assessment of the Institutions, the ESM financial assistance facility agreement will cover an amount of up to EUR 86 bn. This includes a buffer of up to EUR 25 bn for the banking sector in order to address potential bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. 
The first tranche under the ESM programme of EUR 26 bn will consist of two sub-tranches. The first sub-tranche of EUR 10 bn will be made available immediately in a segregated account at the ESM for bank recapitalisation and resolution purposes. The second sub-tranche of EUR 16 bn will be disbursed to Greece in several instalments, starting with a first disbursement of EUR 13 bn by 20 August, followed by one or more further disbursements in the autumn subject to the implementation of key milestones based on measures outlined in the MoU and to be specified by the European Institutions and agreed by the EWG. 
A second tranche for banking recapitalisation and resolution needs of up to EUR 15 bn can be made available after the first review and no later than 15 November, subject to the completion of the planned Asset Quality Review and Stress Test and the implementation of the financial sector deliverables of the review. These funds will initially be transferred to the segregated ESM account and can be released upon the agreement of the ESM Board of Directors. 
The debt sustainability assessment was conducted by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB, as foreseen in Article 13(1) of the ESM Treaty. The analysis concludes that debt sustainability can be achieved through a far-reaching and credible reform programme and additional debt related measures without nominal haircuts. In line with the Euro summit statement of 12 July, the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, if necessary, possible additional measures (possible longer grace and repayment periods) aiming at ensuring that Greece's gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level. These measures will be conditional upon full implementation of the measures agreed in the ESM programme and will be considered after the first positive completion of a programme review. The Eurogroup reiterates that nominal haircuts on official debt cannot be undertaken.
The Eurogroup considers the continued programme involvement of the IMF as indispensable and welcomes the intention of the IMF management to recommend to the Fund's Executive Board to consider further financial support for Greece once the full specification of fiscal, structural and financial sector reforms has been completed and once the need for additional measures has been considered and an agreement on possible debt relief to ensure debt sustainability has been reached. Resulting policy conditionality will be a shared one as the policy conditionality underlying the ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme is developed in parallel to the one of the IMF. Once approved, the full re-engagement of the IMF is expected to reduce subsequently the ESM financing envelope accordingly. The Eurogroup welcomes the positive assessment of IMF staff of the policy conditionality contained in the MoU as confirmed by the IMF Managing Director and looks forward to an IMF programme based on the latter.
The Eurogroup considers that the necessary elements are now in place to launch the relevant national procedures required for the approval of the ESM financial assistance. The Eurogroup expects that the ESM Board of Governors will be in a position to authorise the European Commission signing the MoU on behalf of the ESM and approve the proposal for a financial assistance facility agreement by 19 August, subject to completion of national procedures, and thereby unlock the initial tranche of up to EUR 26 bn.

In this context the Eurogroup endorsed the first set of milestones, which Greece needs to implement in order to receive a disbursement of €2 billion. This amount is a sub-tranche of the €3 billion which remain undisbursed from the first tranche of €26 billion, as agreed in the programme.
The Eurogroup encouraged Greece to agree with the institutions on the second set of milestones in the next few weeks. Successful implementation of the second set of milestones would unlock the disbursement of the remaining €1 billion.

The Eurogroup called on the Greek authorities to finalise the financial sector measures, as well as the legislation agreed under the first set of milestones, in the course of the week. This would unlock the disbursement of €2 billion by the ESM and a transfer of the funds needed for the recapitalisation of the Greek banking sector out of the €10 billion earmarked under the programme.
The €10 billion amount was previously released to an ESM segregated account, and can only be transferred to the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) once the agreed conditions are met.

Common ,05.09.2016,"The Eurogroup welcomes the completion of a policy package, which should pave the way for a successful completion of the first review of the ESM programme, upon the adoption of the agreed prior actions.
Greece will implement as part of the prior actions for the first review:
a first package of fiscal parametric measures amounting up to 3% of GDP by 2018; this package includes a pension reform, a reform of the personal income tax and additional fiscal parametric measures, such as a VAT reform and public sector wage bill measures;
an additional contingency mechanism, which will be legislated to ensure that a package of measures, including non-discretionary measures, would be automatically implemented as soon as there is objective evidence of a failure to meet the annual primary surplus targets in the programme (3,5% in the medium-term). If measures are enacted with a temporary nature when the mechanism is triggered, permanent structural measures agreed with the institutions, including revenue measures, should become effective in the year thereafter, as part of the regular budgetary process, in order to bring the budget structurally back on track. Exceptions to the activation of the mechanism will be limited to exceptional events with a major economic impact outside government control. Such exceptions need to be agreed with the institutions. 
The first review includes also the implementation of the NPL strategy, which will contribute to strengthening the balance sheets of banks and enable the return of domestic credit to the Greek economy. As prior actions, measures will be taken to immediately open up the market for the sale and servicing of performing and non-performing loans, with the temporary exclusion of small loans secured by primary residences.
The Eurogroup recalls that a significantly strengthened privatisation programme is a cornerstone of the new ESM programme. In this context, the Eurogroup welcomes the agreement for the forthcoming adoption of the law establishing the agreed Greek Privatisation and Investment Fund, including an initial asset transfer, as part of the prior actions for the first review. The Supervisory Board of the Fund will be appointed by June 2016, and the Fund will become fully operational no later than September.
In line with the statements of the Euro Summit and the Eurogroup in the summer of 2015, the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, if necessary, possible additional debt measures aiming at ensuring that Greece's refinancing needs are kept at sustainable levels in the long-run. These measures will be conditional upon full implementation of measures agreed in the context of the ESM programme, and will be considered after the completion of the first review, once all prior actions have been fully implemented.
The Eurogroup agrees on the following general guiding principles for the possible additional debt measures: (i) facilitating market access; (ii) smoothening the repayment profile; (iii) incentivising the country's adjustment process even after the programme ends; and (iv) flexibility to accommodate uncertain GDP growth and interest rate developments in the future.
The Eurogroup also agrees to establish a benchmark for assessing sustainability of the Greek debt, according to which under the baseline scenario of a debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Greece's gross financing needs should remain on a sustainable path.
The Eurogroup foresees a sequenced approach, whereby a package of debt measures could be phased in progressively, as necessary to meet the agreed benchmark on gross financing needs and subject to the pre-defined conditionality of the ESM programme. The Eurogroup reconfirms that nominal haircuts are excluded, and that all measures taken will be in line with existing EU law and the ESM and EFSF legal frameworks. The Eurogroup will consider:

For the short term: possibilities to optimize debt management of the programme.
For the medium term: the Eurogroup asks the EWG to explore specific measures (such as longer grace and payment periods) which can be used, if necessary, at the end of the ESM programme, conditional upon the successful implementation of the ESM programme, as well as such measures as the use of the SMP and ANFA equivalent profits.
For the long term: the Eurogroup stands ready, if necessary, and conditional upon compliance with the primary surplus targets, to further assess at the end of the programme the need for possible additional debt measures to ensure Greece's gross financing needs remain on a sustainable path.
The Eurogroup mandates the EWG to work further on the technicalities of this package of debt measures and to report back to the next regular Eurogroup on 24 May.
Together with the agreement and implementation of the policy package, this agreement on debt and adequate financing assurances by the European partners are expected to allow the IMF to participate in the programme.
The Eurogroup calls upon the institutions and the Greek authorities to complete in the coming days the technical work on the staff level agreement on the first review, including the contingency mechanism. In this context, the Eurogroup looks forward to receive rapidly the draft supplemental MoU, including the final full list of prior actions, as well as the compliance report for the first review. It calls upon the Greek authorities to take immediate steps to implement the prior actions including through the adoption of legislation. Upon full implementation of the prior actions by the Greek authorities and following national procedures where necessary, the Eurogroup stands ready to support the disbursement of the second tranche of the ESM programme.

Common ,05.25.2016,"The Eurogroup welcomes that a full staff-level agreement has been reached between Greece and the institutions. Also, the Eurogroup notes with satisfaction that the Greek authorities and the European institutions have reached an agreement on the contingency fiscal mechanism, which is in line with the Eurogroup statement adopted on 9 May in particular as regard the possible adoption of permanent structural measures, including revenue measures, to be agreed with the institutions. It therefore provides further reassurances that Greece will meet the primary surplus targets of the ESM programme (3.5% of GDP in the medium-term), without prejudice to the obligations of Greece under the SGP and the Fiscal Compact. 
The Eurogroup also welcomes the adoption by the Greek parliament of most of the agreed prior actions for the first review, notably the adoption of legislation to deliver fiscal parametric measures amounting to 3% of GDP that should allow to meet the fiscal targets in 2018, to open up the market for the sale of loans and to establish the agreed Greek Privatisation and Investment Fund that should operate in full independence. The Eurogroup mandates the EWG to verify in the next few days the full implementation of the outstanding prior actions on the basis of an assessment by the institutions, in particular the corrections to the legislation on the opening up of the market for the sale of loans, and on the pension reform, as well as the completion of all prior actions related to the government pending actions in the field of privatization. 
Following the full implementation of all prior actions and subject to the completion of national procedures, the ESM governing bodies are expected to endorse the supplemental MoU and approve the disbursement of the second tranche of the ESM programme. The second tranche under the ESM programme amounting to EUR 10.3 bn will be disbursed to Greece in several disbursements, starting with a first disbursement in June (EUR 7.5 bn) to cover debt servicing needs and to allow a clearance of an initial part of arrears as a means to support the real economy. The subsequent disbursements to be used for arrears clearance and further debt servicing needs will be made after the summer. The disbursements for arrears clearance will be subject to a positive reporting by the European Institutions on the clearance of net arrears. The additional disbursement for debt servicing needs will be subject to milestones related to privatization, including the new Privatization and Investment Fund, bank governance, revenue agency and energy sector to be assessed by the European institutions and verified by the EWG and the ESM Board of Directors. 
In line with the 9 May Eurogroup statement, and in view of the forthcoming full implementation of all the prior actions by Greece and completion of the first review, the Eurogroup considered today the sustainability of Greek public debt. 
The Eurogroup agrees to assess debt sustainability with reference to the following benchmark for gross financing needs (GFN): under the baseline scenario, GFN should remain below 15% of GDP during the post programme period for the medium term, and below 20% of GDP thereafter. 
The Eurogroup recalls the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP as of 2018 and underlines the importance of a fiscal trajectory consistent with the fiscal commitments under the EU framework. 
The Eurogroup recalls the following general guiding principles agreed on 9 May for possible additional debt measures: (i) facilitating market access in order to replace over time public financed debt with privately financed debt; (ii) smoothening the repayment profile; (iii) incentivising the country's adjustment process even after the programme ends; and (iv) flexibility to accommodate uncertain GDP growth and interest rate developments in the future. On 9 May the Eurogroup also reconfirmed that nominal haircuts are excluded, and that all measures taken will be in line with existing EU law and the ESM and EFSF legal frameworks. 
Guided by these principles and on the basis of technical work carried out by the EWG, the Eurogroup agreed today on a package of debt measures which will be phased in progressively, as necessary to meet the agreed benchmark on gross financing needs and will be subject to the pre-defined conditionality of the ESM programme. 
For the short-term, the Eurogroup agrees on a first set of measures which will be implemented after the closure of the first review up to the end of the programme and which includes: 
Smoothening the EFSF repayment profile under the current weighted average maturity
Use EFSF/ESM diversified funding strategy to reduce interest rate risk without incurring any additional costs for former programme countries
Waiver of the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme for the year 2017
The Eurogroup asks the EFSF and ESM management to take these measures forward within their mandate, on the basis of preparatory work by the EWG, and where needed to prepare formal decision making by the relevant EFSF and ESM decision-making bodies. The decision on the smoothening of the EFSF repayment profile and the reduction of interest rate risks should be taken as a matter of priority. 
For the medium term, the Eurogroup expects to implement a possible second set of measures following the successful implementation of the ESM programme. These measures will be implemented if an update of the debt sustainability analysis produced by the institutions at the end of the programme shows they are needed to meet the agreed GFN benchmark, subject to a positive assessment from the institutions and the Eurogroup on programme implementation. 

Abolish the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme as of 2018
Use of 2014 SMP profits from the ESM segregated account and the restoration of the transfer of ANFA and SMP profits to Greece (as of budget year 2017) to the ESM segregated account as an ESM internal buffer to reduce future gross financing needs.  
Liability management - early partial repayment of existing official loans to Greece by utilizing unused resources within the ESM programme to reduce interest rate costs and to extend maturities. Due account will be taken of exceptionally high burden of some Member States.
If necessary, some targeted EFSF re-profiling (e.g. extension of the weighted average maturities, re-profiling of the EFSF amortization as well as capping and deferral of interest payments) to the extent needed to keep GFN under the agreed benchmark in order to give comfort to the IMF and without incurring any additional costs for former programme countries or to the EFSF.
For the long-term, the Eurogroup is confident that the implementation of this agreement on the main features for debt measures, together with a successful implementation of the Greek ESM programme and the fulfilment of the primary surplus targets as mentioned above, will bring Greece's public debt back on a sustainable path over the medium to long run and will facilitate a gradual return to market financing. At the same time, the Eurogroup agrees on a contingency mechanism on debt which would be activated after the ESM programme to ensure debt sustainability in the long run in case a more adverse scenario were to materialize. The Eurogroup would consider the activation of the mechanism provided additional debt measures are needed to meet the GFN benchmark defined above and would be subject to a decision by the Eurogroup confirming that Greece complies with the requirements under the SGP. Such mechanism could entail measures such as a further EFSF re-profiling and capping and deferral of interest payments. Also, the Eurogroup commits to long-term technical assistance to boost Greek growth. 
The Eurogroup recognises that over the exceptionally long time horizon of assessing debt sustainability there can be no forecasts, only assumptions, given the sizable degree of uncertainty over macroeconomic developments. 
Against the background of the forthcoming successful completion of the first review and the agreement on debt relief, the Eurogroup welcomes the intention of the IMF management to recommend to the Fund's Executive Board to approve a financial arrangement before the end of 2016 that will support the implementation of the agreed fiscal and structural reforms. It is recognised that, consistent with IMF policies, approval of this arrangement will also be based on a new DSA and the assessment of possible debt relief measures mentioned above. The possible debt relief will be delivered at the end of the programme in mid-2018 and the scope will be determined by the Eurogroup on the basis of a revised DSA in cooperation with the European Institutions for purposes of taking into account the European policy framework, subject to full implementation of the programme. 
The Eurogroup stands ready, in line with usual practice, to support the completion of future reviews provided that the policy package considered today, including the contingency mechanism, is implemented as planned.  The Eurogroup confirms that programme implementation, as well as policy conditionality and targets, will be reviewed regularly based on input from the institutions.

Common ,12.05.2016,"The Eurogroup welcomes the progress that has been made in reaching full staff-level agreement between Greece and the institutions in the context of the second review of the ESM programme. In particular, the Eurogroup welcomes the agreement with the European institutions on a budget for 2017, which confirms the agreed primary balance target of 1.75% of GDP and which allows for the national rollout of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI), which establishes a genuine social safety net. The Eurogroup notes that staff-level agreement should include measures to reach the agreed fiscal target for 2018 (a primary balance of 3.5% of GDP), as well as reforms to enhance growth and cost competitiveness, including further substantial reforms of the labour market, the opening up of closed professions and the removal of barriers for investment. 
In particular, the Eurogroup recalls that the appointment of the members of the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) should be implemented before the end of January 2017 to make the fund fully operational. 
The Eurogroup recalled that the primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP reached by 2018 should be maintained for the medium-term. We also recalled the importance of a fiscal trajectory that is consistent with the fiscal commitments under the EU framework. In order to ensure compliance with the fiscal targets in a sustainable manner after the completion of the programme, the Greek authorities commit to agree with the institutions on a mechanism and structural measures that would ensure this. 
Today the Eurogroup discussed again the sustainability of Greek public debt with the objective to regain market access. In this context, the Eurogroup endorsed today the full set of short-term measures on the basis of proposals by the ESM and preparatory work by the EWG, which will be implemented by the ESM following this meeting.  Those measures will consist of: 
The smoothening of the EFSF repayment profile within the current weighted average maturity of up to 32,5 years;
The waiver of the step-up interest rate margin amounting to 200 bps related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme for the year 2017;
The use of the EFSF/ESM funding strategy as markets allow to reduce interest rate risk without incurring any additional costs for former programme countries. This measure will be implemented through: (i) exchanging the EFSF/ESM back-to back notes supporting the bank recapitalization loans to Greece, (ii) the ESM entering into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of higher market rates and  (iii) introducing matched funding for future disbursements to Greece under the current programme.
The short-term debt measures will have a significant positive impact on the sustainability of Greek debt. 
The Eurogroup calls upon the institutions and Greece to swiftly resume negotiations in order to reach staff-level agreement as soon as possible, based on a shared conditionality, as agreed in August 2015, and mandates the EWG to assess this. The Eurogroup stands ready, in line with usual practice, to support the completion of future reviews provided that the policy package, including the contingency fiscal mechanism as agreed in the context of the first review, is implemented as planned. The Eurogroup confirms that the programme implementation, as well as policy conditionality and targets, will be reviewed regularly based on input from the institutions. 
The IMF staff reconfirmed today its intention to recommend to the Fund's Executive Board a new financing arrangement for Greece as soon as possible once staff-level agreement is reached in accordance with established Fund policies. 
The full implementation of all prior actions related to the second review and the completion of national procedures would pave the way for the ESM governing bodies to approve the supplemental Memorandum of Understanding.

Common ,01.26.2017,"The institutions briefed the Eurogroup on the second review of the economic adjustment programme, following their review mission to Athens in December.
The Eurogroup urged the Greek authorities and the institutions to swiftly resume negotiations to agree on a policy reform package shared by all stakeholders. Such an agreement is a condition for the successful conclusion of the second review.
The reforms concern Greece's labour and product markets, its energy sector and other areas. An agreement on Greece's medium-term fiscal strategy, i.e. in 2018 and beyond, is also expected.
The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is providing the financing for the programme, informed ministers about progress made in implementing the short-term debt relief measures for Greece. These measures were endorsed by the Eurogroup in December and formally adopted by the ESM and EFSF (European Financial Stability Facility) boards of directors on 23 January 2017.
The measures aim to reduce interest rate risk for Greece, including by changing some debt rates from floating to fixed, and to make the burden of debt repayment easier. They do not have any budgetary implications for the ESM shareholders, which are the euro area member states.

Common ,02.20.2017,"The institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism) and Greek Minister for Finance Euclid Tsakalotos briefed the Eurogroup on the second review of Greece's economic adjustment programme, where the main outstanding issues include the medium-term (in 2018 and beyond) fiscal strategy and labour market reform.
The Eurogroup welcomed the common understanding reached between the Greek authorities and the institutions, which allows the review mission to return to Athens and resume work in order to conclude a staff-level agreement on policy reforms in the context of the second review of the programme.
A staff-level agreement is a necessary condition for the successful conclusion of reviews and therefore for receiving financial support.

The Greek authorities and the institutions continue aiming for a swift conclusion of the staff-level agreement, based on the common understanding they reached last month. They will hold intensive talks in Brussels in the coming days, focusing on the main outstanding issues. These include the growth-friendly rebalancing of Greece's public finances over the medium term (in 2018 and beyond) and the labour market reform.

The institutions and the Greek authorities reached an agreement on the main elements of the policy reforms required to move ahead with the second review of the current macroeconomic adjustment programme, which is necessary to unlock further financial assistance to Greece. This agreement refers to the size, timing and sequencing of the reforms.

The institutions will continue technical work in Athens as soon as possible to swiftly conclude a staff level agreement.

Common ,05.22.2017,"The Eurogroup welcomed the preliminary agreement reached between Greece and the institutions on a new set of policy reforms to support the country's economic recovery. The agreement is an important step towards the finalisation of the second review of Greece's macroeconomic adjustment programme.
The Eurogroup commended the progress achieved by Greece in already implementing a significant part of the agreed prior actions.
The reform measures, legislated by Greece, cover areas such as pensions, income tax, the labour market and the energy sector. They should support the growth-friendly rebalancing of the economy and make Greece's medium-term fiscal strategy more robust.
The Eurogroup held an in-depth discussion on the sustainability of Greece's public debt but did not reach an overall agreement. Work will continue in the coming weeks within the framework agreed in May 2016 with a view to reaching a definitive conclusion at the next Eurogroup meeting.

Common ,06.15.2017,"The Eurogroup finalised its discussion on the ongoing second review of Greece's macroeconomic adjustment programme financed by the European Stability Mechanism.
The Eurogroup welcomed the adoption of the agreed prior actions by Greece's parliament. They were part of the set of policy reforms the country had agreed with the institutions (European Commission, European Central Bank, European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund) on 2 May 2017.
The reform measures cover areas such as pensions, income tax, the labour market as well as the financial and energy sectors. These should make Greece's medium-term fiscal strategy more robust and support the growth-friendly rebalancing of the economy. 
The Eurogroup invited Greece together with the institutions and relevant third parties to develop and support a holistic, growth enhancing strategy.
The Eurogroup reconfirmed its approach to the sustainability of Greece's public debt that was agreed in May 2016, while providing some further detail on the medium-term debt measures that could accrue to Greece.
These measures would be implemented after successful completion of the programme, if a new debt sustainability analysis were to confirm that such measures are necessary.
The Eurogroup welcomed Greece's commitment to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2022, and a fiscal path consistent with the European fiscal framework thereafter. According to analysis by the European Commission, such compliance would be achieved with a primary surplus of equal to or above but close to 2.0% of GDP in the period of 2023-2060.
Against this background, IMF management will shortly recommend that the IMF Executive Board approve in principle a new, 14-month Standby Arrangement for Greece.
The European Stability Mechanism will be able to proceed with the next tranche of financial assistance to Greece available under the programme after the euro area member states have completed their relevant national procedures authorising the disbursement. The next tranche will amount to €8.5bn.
