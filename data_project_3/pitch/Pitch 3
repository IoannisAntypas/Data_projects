Pitch 3 

Who are the lobbyists of Brusses/ Is your neighbour a European lobbyist?

This is part two of my investigation on lobbying in Europe. Last project I examined whether the number of lobbyists in Brussels had risen after Brexit. This week, I would like to use the transparency register again to find out which individuals/companies/ngos are registered, and where are they situated. 


Summary

This time we will map every single company that is included in the transparency register and cluster them together per country. Each company will be a dot in the map, which when clicked will reveal the companys' name, address, legal status, website address, phone and post box, person with legal responsibility, person in charge of eu relations, goals, level of interest, interests with the EU, company size, fields of interest, EU grants secured.

Details

I will be using the same dataset as last project, taking all of the data from them and mapping them with leaflet. 

Possible headline(s):

Do you live next to an EU lobby?

Data set(s):

Its another map/interactivity and with points. I have never done that so I hope I get it right.

Identified and downloaded my dataset. Found the different areas I will measure
