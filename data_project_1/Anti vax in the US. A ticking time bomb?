Anti vax in the US. A ticking time bomb?

As the anti vaccination movement continues to pick up steam, resulting in fewer immunized schoolchildren, preventable diseases begin to reappear at an alarming rate in most parts of the world, include the US. Is this a toxic mix, herald to a healthcare crisis that has yet to come? 

The antivaccination movement, now in sync with the wider "post truth" societal context that seems to be establishing itself as a cultural norm, poses a serious threat to societies across the US. An in initialy fringe movement, it is currently endorsed by numerous public figures, including President Trump, who tweeted "No more massive injections. Tiny children are not horsesâ€”one vaccine at a time, over time.". 

Preliminary research shows that in the US, the rate of school immunization is reducing, while preventable disease are making a comeback. Is this a cause for alarm?

The pitch envisions the creation of one choropleth map, colored according to the % of immunized school children in each US State, and points, reflecting outbreaks of preventable diseases such as MMR.

A high concentration of preventable disease outbreaks at an area where the % of immunized school children is relatively low (>90%), presents a higher risk of contagion and spread of such viruses.
