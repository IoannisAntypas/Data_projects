Pierre Moscovici,02.24.2015,"Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis and Commissioner Pierre Moscovici sent today the following letter to the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, on the Greek government's reform proposals:

""The Commission services have carefully reviewed the Greek government's reform proposals sent to you yesterday as President of the Eurogroup. This has been preceded by constructive exchanges over the week-end between the Greek authorities and representatives of the European Commission and the other institutions.
In the view of the Commission, this list is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point for a successful conclusion of the review as called for by the Eurogroup at its last meeting.
We are encouraged by the commitment to combat tax evasion and corruption, inter alia through efforts to modernise tax and custom administrations, as well as to pursue reforms to modernise the public administration. The Commission also notes the commitments in the area of statistics and considers it of vital importance that the institutional and operational independence of ELSTAT and its senior management be respected at all times.
Further specification of the reforms in these and other key areas is expected to be provided and agreed before the end of April, in line with last week's Eurogroup statement. The Commission looks forward to working with the new administration to elaborate what are at the moment still general commitments and transform these into clear policy actions.
The Commission underlines its willingness to continue to provide technical assistance in key areas to assist in the design and implementation of policies. As part of this process, the Commission underlines the importance of Greece fully respecting its commitment undertaken at the Eurogroup of 20 February 2015 to refrain from any roll back of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions.
Determined and swift implementation of reform commitments will be key for a successful conclusion of the review.""

Pierre Moscovici,08.13.2015,"On 11 August, the European Commission, the ECB and the ESM, with the input from the IMF, reached a comprehensive agreement at staff level with the Greek government on the MoU that will constitute part of the Loan agreement.
In response to a request of 8 July 2015 from the Hellenic Republic to the Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for stability support in the form of a loan with an availability period of three years, the Eurogroup has asked the Institutions to agree on a Memorandum of Understanding detailing the conditionality for a financial assistance facility covering the period 2015-18 in accordance with Article 13(3) of the ESM Treaty.
On 11 August, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Stability Mechanism, with the input from the International Monetary Fund, reached a comprehensive agreement at staff level with the Greek government on the Memorandum of Understanding that will constitute part of the Loan agreement to be signed between the Hellenic Republic and the ESM.
The negotiations of the Memorandum of Understanding on the ground in Athens aimed at agreeing a credible and comprehensive package of reforms. The IMF provided input into the technical analysis and the design of conditionality for the new ESM programme. The conditionality will be updated on a quarterly basis, taking into account the progress in reforms achieved over the previous quarter. This agreement is in line with the Euro Summit Statement of 13 July. It still needs to be approved at political level, ratified by Member States and endorsed by the ESM’s Board of Governors and Board of Directors.
The European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund acknowledge the very good cooperation of the Greek authorities during the review mission, which has made possible this agreement after several months of negotiations.
This reform package will enable Greece to address the remaining imbalances in the economy in order to bring it back on a sustainable growth path, while also addressing in a determined way the social challenges facing the Greek society. The credibility of the agreement is underpinned by a significant number of upfront reforms, including important measures that address long-standing structural challenges facing the Greek economy such as revenue collection, pensions and health systems, competition in product market and professions and energy, which show the intention of the Greek government to normalise the situation in the economy quickly.
Implementation of the reform agenda will provide the basis for a sustainable recovery, and the policies are built around four pillars:
Restoring fiscal sustainability: Greece will target a medium-term primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP to be achieved through a combination of upfront parametric fiscal reforms supported by an ambitious programme to strengthen tax compliance and public financial management, and fight tax evasion, while ensuring adequate protection of vulnerable groups. A major reform of the pension system will eliminate disincentives to work, and address sizeable imbalances which threaten fiscal sustainability. In pursuit of this medium-term goal and taking into account the deterioration in the economic situation, the authorities will accordingly pursue a new fiscal path premised on a primary surplus balance targets of -¼, 0.5, 1¾, and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and beyond, respectively. The trajectory of the fiscal targets is consistent with expected growth rates of the Greek economy as it recovers from its deepest recorded recession.
Safeguarding financial stability: Greece will immediately take urgently needed steps to tackle the non-performing loan (NPL) problem in the banking sector. The extraordinarily high level of NPLs and the related over-indebtedness of the private sector divert significant resources from more productive uses and prevent the banking sector from providing the necessary credit in support of a recovery of growth. In addition, a recapitalisation process of banks, to be completed before the end of 2015, will contribute to a stabilisation of the situation in the banking sector. This will be accompanied by concomitant measures to strengthen the governance of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) and of banks. Together with other programme policies this is expected to foster a normalisation of the liquidity situation in the banking sector, allowing a concomitant gradual easing of capital controls.
Growth, competitiveness and investment: Greece will design and implement a wide range of reforms in labour markets and product markets (including energy) that not only ensure full compliance with EU requirements, but which also aim at achieving European best practices. There will be an ambitious privatisation programme, and policies which support investment. The structural reform package to be enacted is significant, particularly in the area of business environment and competition policies, which are key for unlocking the growth potential of the economy.
A modern State and public administration shall be a key priority of the programme. Particular attention will be paid to increasing the efficiency of the public sector in the delivery of essential public goods and services. Measures will be taken to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system, including by implementing the recently adopted new Code of Civil Procedure, and to upgrade the fight against corruption. Reforms will strengthen the institutional and operational independence of key institutions such as revenue administration and the statistics institute (ELSTAT).
The agreed strategy takes into account the need for social justice and fairness, both across and within generations. Fiscal constraints have imposed hard choices, and it is therefore important that the burden of adjustment is borne by all parts of society and takes into account the ability to pay. Priority has been placed on actions to tackle tax evasion, fraud and strategic defaulters, as these impose a burden on the honest citizens and companies who pay their taxes and loans on time. Product market reforms seek to eliminate the rents accruing to vested interest groups: through higher prices, these undermine the disposable income of consumers and harm competitiveness. Pension reforms have focussed on measures to remove exemptions and provide incentives for continued labour market participation end early retirement. To get people back to work and prevent the entrenching of long-term unemployment, the authorities, working closely with European partners, will initiate measures to boost employment by 50.000 people targeting the long-term unemployed. A fairer society will require that Greece improves the design of its welfare system, so that there is a genuine social safety net which targets scarce resources at those who need it most. The authorities plan to benefit from available technical assistance from international organisations on measures to provide access to health care for all (including the uninsured) and to roll out a basic social safety net in the form of a Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI).
The Institutions are committed to continue working with the Greek authorities on all aspects of this agreement, including on providing Technical Assistance on a number of reform areas foreseen in the programme. Compliance with the conditionality of the Memorandum of Understanding will be monitored by the Commission, in liaison with the ECB and together with the IMF, as foreseen in Article 13(7) of the ESM Treaty.

Pierre Moscovici,11.17.2015,"The Greek authorities and the institutions have reached substantive agreement on all outstanding issues regarding the measures included in the first set of milestones and on the financial sector measures that are essential for a successful recapitalisation process.
This is good news.  
The Eurogroup Working Group discussed the state of play today and welcomed the substantive progress made. 
Legislation will be adopted in the Greek parliament on Thursday.  
Upon the completion of the agreed conditionality and the implemented legislation, the Eurogroup/EWG stand ready to support the disbursement of the €2 billion sub-tranche linked to the first set of milestones and the transfer to the HFSF of the funds needed for the recapitalisation of the Greek banking sector, as required, out of the €10 billion earmarked for this purpose.

Pierre Moscovici,02.11.2016,"Now a word on Greece.
Our winter forecast last week highlighted the surprising resilience of the Greek economy to the uncertainty of last year and the introduction of capital controls. Provided reform momentum is maintained, the economy should start growing again in the second half of this year.
In terms of the first review mission, there were constructive talks in Athens last week and good progress was made on a number of fronts. Intense work is now ongoing at the technical level. This work needs to continue at an adequate pace in the coming days so that our mission chiefs can return to Athens as soon as possible and take forward negotiations with a view to reaching a staff level agreement in the coming weeks.
I want to stress two things: First, I know that the reforms being discussed at the moment are in many cases very difficult – politically, socially. The pension reform is of course the most obvious example of this. But, and this is my second point, these necessary reforms will not become any easier by delaying the moment when they need to be agreed and adopted. So I am encouraged, as all members of the Eurogroup, by the Greek authorities’ statements that they intend to work for a swift conclusion of the review. For our part, we will of course work as hard as is needed to facilitate that. The general mood of discussion was positive concerning progress made although we know that we are not there yet and that there is still some way to go.

Pierre Moscovici,10.10.2016,"Thank you Jeroen. Bonsoir à toutes et à tous. The European Commission is never jetlagged. We always try to be helpful to the Presidency. Today we gave the go-ahead for the ESM Board of Directors to decide on disbursement of the EUR 1.1 billion linked to the first review.
This decision was based on a compliance report of the Commission and the other institutions that showed that all remaining 15 milestones had been completed.  This included key issues such as on pensions, bank governance, energy, privatisation and the revenue administration. I would like to thank my colleague Euclid Tsakalotos for his efforts and the Greek authorities to complete this work.
Like I told Members of the European Parliament last week, the efforts that led to today´s decision cover practically all parts of the Greek economy. The measures will lead to budget savings of 3% between 2016 and 2018. I share the President's views about the state of the Greek economy, we have quite good news from growth and budget execution.
I also welcome the significant progress that has been made in clearing so-called arrears –Progress on this front must and will continue, technical work is ongoing and it is critical to relieving pressure on the real economy.
Today's decision to disburse EUR 1.1 billion is an important step in this heavily frontloaded programme. It also opens the door for the second review of the programme to start.
I am happy that we have reached this point. We must absolutely go on to build a success story with Greece and as I said, Greece is on the right path.
Our teams will be in Athens in the second half of October to start the technical work of the second review, which will move the focus from legislating to implementation of the reforms, which is not easy but as decisive
",http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-16-3368_en.htm
Pierre Moscovici,02.20.2017,"The further fiscal measures to be pre-legislated for the period immediately following the programme will serve to reassure all partners of Greece's commitment to maintaining sound fiscal policies in the future.
Let's be clear, we still have some hard work ahead of us. Everything is not finished today. We still need to narrow our differences in terms of fiscal projections. And we still need to agree on all the details of the policy package to conclude the second review. But as I have always said, where there's a will, there's a way – and today we have clearly seen that the will is there.
We will in particular work to support efforts to boost employment in Greece. In terms of labour market measures, we will work to swiftly finalise our common understanding. We also stand ready to support Greece in its efforts to roll out active labour market policies and to explore how best to provide the necessary financing for this and the Commission is clearly committed to help the Greek authorities in that direction.
I would like to underline the fact that all actors today recognised the progress that Greece has made in economic and budgetary terms:
	•	        As a reminder, the economy is expected to have grown by 0.3% in 2016, compared to initial projections of another year of recession. And with confidence coming back in Greece, growth should be at 2.7% for this year and around 3% for next year.
	•	        At the same time, fiscal data continue to surprise on the positive side. Full-year budget execution data for 2016 showed strong dynamics on the revenue side with expenditures having developed below budgeted ceilings. And January data on revenue collection confirm the continuation of these trends.
	•	        Moreover, it is now evident that Greece has significantly over-performed its 2016 primary surplus target – likely to achieve a surplus of at least 2% of GDP, compared to the programme target of 0.5%. If this is confirmed by Eurostat in April, it would also mean the primary surplus has already surpassed its 2017 target of 1.75% of GDP and is already well on the way to meet its 2018 global goal.
	•	        We need to nurture and we need to strengthen this progress. This is why it is so important to now accelerate along the path to an overall agreement, to build on this positive dynamic for Greece.

Pierre Moscovici,05.02.2017,"""The agreement reached overnight in Athens on the Greek Stability Support Programme is a very positive development following months of complex negotiations. These new efforts agreed by the Greek authorities open the way for a rapid conclusion of the second review. The swift implementation of these commitments should enable the Eurogroup to endorse this agreement at its next meeting. This second review is strategic for Greece as it not only delivers on key reforms to modernise the Greek economy but also secures a credible fiscal path for the years to come, beyond the ESM programme. It is now for all partners to reach an understanding on the question of Greece's debt in the coming weeks. It is time to turn the page on this long and difficult austerity chapter for the Greek people. With this agreement, we need now to write a new story of stability, jobs and growth for Greece and for the euro area as a whole.""
