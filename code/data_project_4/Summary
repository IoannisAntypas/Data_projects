Summary

We will examine the sentiments of two key EU figures, Jeroen Dijsselbloem (Dutch finance minister and President of the Eurogroup) and Pierre Moscovici (French, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs), in his post Eurogroup press conferences regarding Greece, and figure out their sentiments when speaking about Greece, and what they can tell us about the manner of speech of top EU bureaucrats.

We will plot them against major milestones in the Greek crisis saga.

Details

Once a month, or when things are really bad, multiple times per month (or multiple times per week, [it has happened]), the EU finance ministers whose countries have adopted the Euro currency, gather up and form the notorious Eurogroup, an informal council of ministers, where some of the most important decisions for the economy of Europe are taken. 

Greece has been experiencing a seemingly unending economic crisis the past 7 years, often being at the center of the Eurogroup discussions. In fact, the Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem who was selected by the other Euro-area finance ministers to be the President of the Eurogroup, placed Greece in the agenda of every meeting for the entire year preemptively.

Possible headline(s):

Just how sentimental does the Eurogroup get about Greece/ Moscovici and Dijsselbloem, two sentimental figures when it comes to Greece
