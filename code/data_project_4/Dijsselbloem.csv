Jeroen Dijsselbloem,01.26.2015,"Good evening and welcome to this press conference. This was our first Eurogroup of the New Year and already a lot has happened. Of course we discussed the latest news, which was the outcome of last nights Greek elections and we were informed about last week's decision by the ECB. But we had more on our agenda. Today we discussed a wide range of topics: Lithuania's euro changeover, the Commission's flexibility paper with a lot of focus on reforms, the economic situation in the euro area.    
We are first going to Greece. Let me first of all say, from this podium, that we of course congratulate the party that won the Greek elections and have now formed a Greek government and that we wish them, of course, success in their work and we look forward to working with them, the way we worked with the previous Greek government. We will support them in their quest for economic recovery of Greece. We are glad that their ambition is to realise this within the Eurozone and that is exactly our ambition too. I am sure you will have a lot of questions of what will now happen, the current programme, the future etc, but there is very little I can say about it at this moment, for the simple reason that the new Greek government has yet to take office, get started. It is too early to say what their intentions, ambitions in the short term regarding programmes etc. So it is really hard for me to respond to that. I think we will need a little bit of patience and we also discussed this in the Eurogroup that we must allow the new Greek government to take their positions and give their points of view on how to move forward. Both in finalising the pending review and any other further support from the Eurozone to Greece. On awaiting that outcome, we have some time to come to this in our next Eurogroup meeting in February. So, this all is very disappointing if this is all I can say on Greece.  
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,02.12.2015,"Today, as you well know, we had an extra Eurogroup to start our talks with the new Greek colleague, to already cover some ground in advance of the regular Eurogroup, which is  on Monday.
It was the first opportunity to meet and to listen to the new Greek colleague on their plans, ambitions of their government.  And that was very welcome and useful. We had an intense discussion and constructive, covering a lot of ground, also making progress, but not enough progress at this point to come to joint conclusions. So, we will continue our talks on Monday.
On Monday, we have a regular Eurogroup, with a number of items on the agenda, but we will also continue our talks on Greece and our current and future cooperation with Greece. That is where we stand. So, there are no real conclusions, which I can share with you. You will have to bear with us a little longer. We will continue our talks on Monday. And that is as far I can go, at this point. I am open to all your questions, but I am already going to say to you to be patient and I will probably repeat that five times to your questions. But I will try anyway.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,02.16.2015,"Then turning to the Greece, as you remember the outcome of the last Eurogroup was that in the end we did not agree on the way forward. We have been drafting the statement but we couldn't finalize, we did not get the final agreement on that. 
The day after I spoke to Prime Minister Tsipras and together with him we've agreed to ask the institutions to at least start the technical work, the technical assessment of where are we in the current program, what are the elements that the new government could agree to. There was an assumption of 70/30 - they could possibly agree to 70% but not to 30% - so we asked the institutions to look at that assumption and then to look at possible replacement measures that which would come from the new Greek government's plans to fill in the 30.
Today we were reported back to us by the institutions how all these talks which took place on Friday and Saturday. In general the reaction of the ministers of the Eurogroup with a slice of disappointment on the outcome of those talks. Much appreciation to the people who did the work over the course of the weekend. Disappointment over the fact that there was still no firm common ground on what such an adjustment in the program could look like and how much of the program would actually be carried forward by the new Greek government. 
The last couple of days right up till the start of the meeting we also talked with Greek colleagues to see whether we could find adjustments in statements on further steps and we were unable to do so at the start of the meeting. 
In the meeting, after we have been informed by the institutions on the state of play in the program and the 70/30 assumption, we had a round of debates on the steps forward. The general feeling in the Eurogroup is still that the best way forward for the Greek authorities would be to seek an extension of the program. 
The main reason for that is that given the ongoing discussions about how the program should work and the future arrangement for Greece should look like, we simply need more time and the best way for that is to at this point to extent the current program which would then allow us a number of time, a number of months to work on future arrangements. 
Such an extension would allow for the Greeks to use the normal kind of flexibility in the program. Talking to the institutions it would be possible to change measures, put other measures into place, but there would also have to be other safeguards and commitments. The request for extension would have to be accompanied by a number of commitments. Let me just mention the key elements here: 
- yes, there is a flexibility in the program; we are open to discuss the replacing measures, but not by taking unilateral actions; 
- a request to come with the commitment not to roll back any measures, unless agreed with the institutions and unless fully funded; 
- a request should come with an unequivocal commitment from Greece to honour all financial obligations to its creditors and off course to assure stability in the financial sector; 
- on the basis of such an extended program, within which flexibility is possible should be also the commitment for the Greek authorities to successfully conclude the program. We should have the reassurance that that is the intention; 
- any request should be on the basis of the commitment to work closely and to continue the dialogue with the institutions and the Eurogroup. 
On this basis, we stand ready to continue our discussions. It is now up to the Greek authorities to decide whether they would want such an extension, whether they would take up the offer to look for the flexibility within the program, but also to give of the kind of commitments that I've just mentioned which are very important to all members of the Eurogroup. 
There was a very strong opinion across the whole Eurogroup, that the next step has to come from the Greek authorities. They have to make up their mind to whether they will ask for an extension in the current program, as I said - using the flexibility and at the same time giving of the main commitments.
In terms of process, giving the timelines that we have and parliamentary deadlines, I think we can use this week, but that is about it. If the request for an extension would come in, we would of course look at it, ask the institutions to review it and advise us and then we could have, if a positive outcome can be envisaged, the extra Eurogroup of Friday, but that is for the later moment to decide. That is where we stand for now.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,02.20.2015,"Good evening and welcome to this press conference. We had a very intense meeting regarding a very important decision on the request for extension of the Greek programme. It was intense because it was about building trust between us. The trust on a basis of the agreements and changes in them that will have to be worked out. There is a hope to reach in the end a positive outcome in terms of successful review and conclusion of the programme in time and that requires trust. I think tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding it. As you know trust leaves quicker then it comes and tonight was a very important, I think, step in that process. 
I am glad to report you that the work that we've done over the last weeks has paid off. We have established a common ground again to reach the agreement on the statement. Statement outlines the details of our agreement. I will not read it out but I will outline the main elements: 
- Yesterday we received a request letter from the Greek authorities for an extension of the MFFA for 4 months. Actually I've requested for 6 months, but our decision is to extend it for 4 months;
- In parallel, the Greek authorities also requested to extend the availability period of the EFSF bonds in the HFSF buffer. In view of the assessment of the institutions the Eurogroup agrees that these funds should be held by the EFSF, free of third party rights for the duration of the MFFA extension. These funds which are mend for recapitalisation of banks and therefore will remain available for the duration of the extended agreement and can be used for the purpose of bank recapitalisation in Greece. 
The purpose of the request by the Greek government is to allow for the successful completion of the review on the basis of the conditions of the current agreements. As mentioned in my last press conference, there is flexibility in the programme, and we will make the best use of it. This flexibility will be considered jointly with the Greek authorities and the institutions. 
It will also allow us to bridge the time for discussions between the Eurogroup, the institutions and Greece, on a possible follow-up arrangement in which the IMF will also continue to play its role. 
Let me recall that the formal, successful conclusion of the review will allow for the disbursement of the outstanding tranche of the current EFSF programme and the transfer of the 2014 SMP profits. Both will be subject to approval by the Eurogroup, but as I said - based on the successful conclusion of the review and this is a precondition. 
As we concluded already in our meeting on Monday, a request for extending the programme needed to be underpinned by commitments from the new Greek government. They are outlined, part of them in the letter and part of them in the statement upon which we've agreed tonight. I would like to stress a few key commitments: 
- The authorities have today expressed their strong commitment to a broader and deeper structural reform process and gave their firm commitment to, with immediate effect, refrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral actions that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability which are the 3 key cornerstones of the programme, as assessed by the institutions; 
- In addition, the Greek authorities have reiterated today their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely; 
- On the fiscal side, the Greek authorities have committed to ensure the primary fiscal surpluses or financing proceeds required to guarantee debt sustainability in line with our Eurogroup November 2012 agreement. At the same time, the institutions will, for the primary surplus target for this year, take the economic circumstances into account.
On the basis of these commitments given in the letter and in today's statement we will start the process which will hopefully lead to the successful decision on the extension of the programme. The first step, that we've agreed together with the Greek authorities, in this process is to present the first list of their reform ambitions. Reform measures based first of all of course on the current arrangements, but also using the flexibility that is in the programmes. This first list of reform measures should be available and presented on Monday. The institutions will then provide us with a first view whether this is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point of the process which will ultimately lead to a successful conclusion of the review. So Monday, to summarize - first list of reform measures from the Greek side. The institutions will look at that and give us their first view on whether this is a sufficiently comprehensive as a starting point for the process which will of course in the end hopefully lead to a successful conclusion of the review. 
If the outcome, of course this is our assumption, of that process is positive, that will allow us on Tuesday morning to start the national procedures and that will be the starting point of the formal procedure-decision making. 
This list of the first reforms by the Greek government will later on be further specified, given details and then be assessed and agreed with the institutions, ultimately by the end of April. It can be done sooner and we would welcome it but there has to be an ultimate deadline given also the extension period of 4 months. 
On the basis of the request, the commitments by Greece, the advice from the institutions and our agreement, we will launch the national procedures, as of next week - where needed, of course this is not valid for the all countries - for the extension of the current programme. This will enable the EFSF Board of Directors to formally approve the extension before the end of February. 
Let me finally say that it is very important that the Greek authorities, together with the institutions, resume immediately the work that would allow for the successful conclusion of the review of the next couple of month.
To summarize let me say that I think this is a very positive outcome. It will allow us step by step to get the work that we have to do with Greeks to get back on track. Hopefully we can make a good start with that next week.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,03.09.2015,"After the last Eurogroup decision on the extension of the current programme, today we had a short discussion on Greece, focusing mainly on the process which should have been started after that decision. We agreed today that there is no further time to loose. The discussions between the Greek authorities and the institutions must and will start as from Wednesday (11/03/2015), with a view to achieve a speedy and successful conclusion of the current review. In this context, we agreed that the discussions with the institutions will take place in Brussels. In parallel, as needed, technical teams from the institutions will be welcomed in Athens, with a view to support this process jointly and together also as of Wednesday.
We also underlined the importance of close and efficient cooperation between the Greek authorities and the institutions and underlined the commitments of no unilateral actions and no rolling-back on measures previously agreed needed to be respected at all times. 
Few remarks about the discussion we had on the structural reforms in particular on services sector. As you know we had a couple of rounds of debate in the past months on structural reforms. We talked about high tax burden on labour in different countries and what reforms would be considered on that issue. We talked about stimulating investments in number of occasions. Today we exchanged views on the reform of the service sector.
The service sector, I don't need to explain, is of great economic importance for the whole euro area and improving its performance would generate significant gains that would spread to the rest of the economy. For example, Commission estimates suggest that reducing restrictions to the level of the five best performing countries in the EU would bring gains amounting to around 2.4% of GDP at the EU level. This is extra potential growth if we could bring down the level of restrictions in services to the level of the best five performing countries. 
Since the euro area countries do not have exchange rate flexibilities, other mechanisms are particularly important to adjust to shocks and correct imbalances. This adjustment needs to be facilitated through a proper functioning of markets, where services are an essential element.
Today we focused on the political challenges of reforming the service sector, number of colleagues shared their experiences, successes and failures in tackling vested interests and reducing the burden of excessive regulation. Several Ministers have spoken about examples where the opening hours of shops were extended, or removing unnecessary restrictions in the way of accessing regulated professions such as notaries and pharmacies. We heard some good examples on specific and detailed regulations some countries have. They highlighted key lessons such as the importance of broad consultation, including of experts and stakeholders.
We will return to this issue later this year and we've asked and the Commission will be glad to provide this further analysis of steps forward, sharing best experiences and developing some common ground there.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,04.29.2015,"Today, the institutions informed us about the ongoing talks with the Greek authorities and we took stock of the situation.
As agreed in February, a comprehensive and detailed list of agreed reforms is needed as a basis for a successful conclusion of the current review. I would like to reiterate again that a comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursements can take place. 
Over the past few weeks, there have been intense discussions between the Greek authorities and the institutions. I understand that there have been recently some positive signs, but there are still wide differences to cover and to bridge on substance.
We are all aware that time is running out. Too much time has been lost in the past two months. It is therefore clear that these discussions need to make significantly more progress, so that the institutions can give their green light on the comprehensive package which will then go to the Eurogroup for the political decision. The responsibility for that lies mainly on the side of the Greek authorities. Finding an agreement is first and foremost in Greece's interest. 
I would also like to reiterate that the agreement of 20 February remains our framework for reaching a deal. 
We will take stock of the situation again at our next regular Eurogroup in May.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,05.11.2015,"Let me start with Greece, as it is in the limelight right now. Today, the institutions informed us about the ongoing discussions with the Greek authorities.
As you have seen, we have adopted a quite short statement today in which we have recognised that negotiations have advanced. The new set-up of the negotiations which were put in place after our last meeting in Riga is more efficient, more positive, more constructive, we are making faster progress. Some important issues have now been discussed in depth. But more time is needed to bridge the remaining gaps and to reach a comprehensive agreement.
We therefore in particular welcomed the intention of the Greek authorities to accelerate their work with the institutions, with a view to achieve a successful and timely conclusion of the review. 
As agreed in February, a comprehensive and detailed list of agreed reforms is needed as a basis for a successful conclusion of the current review. I would like to reiterate that the agreement of 20 February remains the framework for the negotiations and that a comprehensive deal is necessary before any disbursements can take place. 
We will continue to monitor the situation and we stand ready to meet as soon as the institutions confirm that there is a basis for a successful conclusion.        
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,06.18.2015,"The Eurogroup today took stock of the situation regarding the programme of Greece. It is regrettable to say that too little progress has been made in the talks between the institutions and Greece, that there is no agreement yet is in sight.
Let me recall that at the basis on which we work is the agreement of the Eurogroup of 20th February and the statement that we agreed upon then. In that agreement, there were two kinds of flexibility. First, we said we would allow the institutions to take into account the current economic situation in Greece and if necessary, adjust the fiscal targets and timelines considering the deterioration of the economic situation in Greece.
The second flexibility which we allowed was to replace measures, both  fiscal measures and reforms, by other measures being put forward by the Greeks after having been being assessed by the institutions. So there was also flexibility within the current MoU to replace measures.
The institutions have made used of those two kinds of flexibilities during their talks with the Greek authorities. But as we stand now, too few measures that have been put forward and assessed are credible and serious and are to be put in a new agreement. Therefore, the talks of the last weeks have not progressed.
Today in our meeting, we sent a strong signal to the Greek authorities that it's really up to them to submit new, additional proposals in the coming days to fully engage with the institutions, within the framework of the Eurogroup statement of 20th February.
As of today, it is still possible to find an agreement and extend the current programme before the end of this month. But the ball is clearly in the Greek court to seize that last opportunity. We feel that an agreement must be credible. It has to be credible from the perspective of sustainable finances and economic recovery in Greece. But also it has to be credible from the point of view of the credibility of our monetary union and the eurozone as a whole. We think that it is still possible, but if such an agreement is sent to the Eurogroup in the coming days we will judge it on that: the credibility both of Greece and for the eurozone as a whole.
Finally, let me again stress that time is really running out. The current programme expires by the end of this month, There are of course parliamentary procedures to consider. Therefore, very little time remains.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,06.22.2015,"Good afternoon everyone. This will be a very short press conference. We have had a short Eurogroup meeting in order to prepare for the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government which will take place at 19.00.
New proposals from the Greek government came in this morning. We welcomed them. They are seen as a positive step in the process. But given the very little time that the institutions have had to look at them, they were unable to give us a full and in-depth assessment. So they gave us a first impression.
The Eurogroup has urged them to work closely together with the Greek authorities; to start immediately with those proposals, going through them, getting into the specifics, doing calculations on them and working on a list of prior actions, which is the key thing that it boils down to. All of this with a view if possible to reaching an agreement later this week, using the Greek proposals as a basis for that.
The work can start immediately as far as we are concerned. If all goes well, the Eurogroup will have another meeting later this week to hear the final outcome of the talks with the Greek authorities. Those talks, as far as we are concerned, can start this afternoon, bringing together the work of the institutions so far with the new proposals, and once again with a view to reaching a final agreement later this week.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,06.24.2015,"The Eurogroup was informed about the state of play in the talks between the institutions and the Greek authorities.
There is no agreement yet.
Work will go on and the Eurogroup will reconvene Thursday, 25 June at 13:00 pm in order to prepare for the European Council.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.05.2015,"On 26 June the Greek authorities decided to reject the proposals by the institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) for Greece's reform plan. The plan, which has been negotiated since February, is a precondition to unlocking the remaining financial assistance for Greece under the current arrangement.
The Greek government decided to call a referendum on these proposals. It is expected to take place on Sunday 5 July 2015, after the expiry date of the current arrangement. 
The current financial assistance arrangement with Greece expires on 30 June 2015. All other arrangements related to Greece's current programme, including transfer by euro area member states of profits from securities markets programme (SMP) and the agreement on net financial assets (ANFA) expire on the same date.
In a statement issued after the first part of the meeting, 18 Eurogroup members regret that the proposal by the institutions has been rejected unilaterally by the Greek authorities.
The ministers of 18 euro area member states continued to hold talks on the further steps to be taken following the breakdown of negotiations between the institutions and the Greek authorities. 
In the statement issued following the discussion, ministers said that the euro area member states intend to make full use of all the instruments available to preserve the integrity and stability of the eurozone. These instruments will complement any actions that the European Central Bank may decide to take.
Ministers stand ready to take decisive steps to further strengthen Economic and Monetary Union. 
The Eurogroup will closely monitor the economic and financial situation in Greece. The Eurogroup is ready to reconvene whenever necessary. 
Ministers agreed that the euro area member states will assist and support Greece and the Greek people as required, following the expiration of Greece's current financial arrangement with the European Financial Stability Facility.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.07.2015,"The Eurogroup welcomed the new Greek Minister for Finance Euclid Tsakalotos who presented the situation in Greece following the referendum on 5 July 2015. 

The Eurogroup exchanged views on the way forward. 

Following the meeting Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem announced that the Greek government would submit a new request for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The request is expected tomorrow, 8 July 2015. 

The Eurogroup is ready to hold a conference call on the same day once the request has been received.

Following the submission of the request, the Eurogroup President will ask the institutions - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - to assess and analyse Greece's financing needs and the debt sustainability.  Following the assessment the Eurogroup will be able to take a decision on whether formal negotiations can start. 

""All of this needs to be done in a matter of days, as we have very little time"", said J.Dijsselbloem.

According to the ESM rules and the EU treaties, financial assistance to member states is provided under strict conditions. Greece's previous financial assistance arrangement with the European Financial Stability Facility expired on 30 June 2015. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.11.2015,"We have adjourned our meeting and will continue tomorrow at 11.00 am. We had an in-depth discussion on Greek proposals. The issue of credibility and trust was discussed and also, of course, the financial issues involved. But we have not concluded our discussion and we will continue at 11.00 am. 
It is still very difficult, but work is still in progress.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.05.2015,"I take note of the outcome of the Greek referendum. This result is very regrettable for the future of Greece. For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities. The Eurogroup will discuss the state of play on Tuesday 7 July.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.12.2015,"The Eurogroup continued the discussion on the recent request by the Greek authorities for financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and their new proposals for the reform agenda, submitted on 9 July 2015. 

The Eurogroup discussed a number of proposals on the way forward, to be approved by the euro area leaders. 

""We have come a long way, but a couple of big issues are still open, so we are going to put those to the leaders to decide"", said Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the meeting.

The President of the Eurogroup will report to the euro area heads of state or government on the state of play.
The Euro Summit meets on the same day (12 July) to continue the discussion.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,07.13.2015,"Good evening everyone. Let me give you a debrief of our agenda. It was a regular Eurogroup meeting, which  followed a string of extra Eurogroup meetings the last couple of weeks. 
We started our meeting by discussing Greece again, but quite briefly and more in organisational terms than on substance today. We followed up on the conclusions of the summit last night. Briefly we discussed possibilities of bridge financing and looked at the timetable, of the steps to take in the coming days and weeks on Greece. Also we had a first round of debate on the 5 presidents' report. The debate will continue tomorrow in the Ecofin and we took stock of an assessment which the Commission is providing us with on the fiscal compact, in particular on the implementation of the fiscal compact in national procedures.
Let me say a little more on Greece. I am sure you have lots of questions about that also. As you know, following the Greek request for a new ESM programme, we had two sessions of the Eurogroup over the weekend with the objective to decide whether to give the official green light, mandate to the institutions to start formally the negotiations on a new ESM programme. we had very intense discussions. At the heart of these discussions was the issue of trust. Other people have spoken about this. President Juncker has spoken about this, which of course over the course of the last months, in particular surrounding the referendum, a lot of that trust was lost and it had to be rebuilt and it still has to be rebuilt. I think, for me personally, the aim has always been to maintain Greece inside the Eurozone. But it has to be done in a credible way. Credible, for Greece: it had to set out a path that would restore financial independence for Greece in the medium term, restore economic development in Greece, maintain fiscal stability in Greece. It had to be credible for Greece for the future. But it had to be credible also for the Eurozone. Any outcome for me is, one of the keystones is that it is credible for the Eurozone. We are a monetary union which is rule-based and it requires a strong commitment of its members to the rules and to the union. And this was also tested. And that was also the reason why we took so much time in the Eurogroup and in the Summit to talk about what is needed to put Greece back on a sustainable economic and fiscal path, but also how to put Greece back in the middle of that rule-based monetary union. And I hope that we will be successful in doing that. 
Let me say a few words on the procedure, moving ahead. Already at the press conference last night I said a few words about this. In the coming days - Wednesday at the latest - the Greek government will put to parliament and hopefully the parliament will approve the package as a whole; including last night's or rather this morning's agreement, and also four specific elements of legislation which were in the agreement.  If that is successful - the institutions will inform us whether that has been successful -we will have a Eurogroup conference call either on Wednesday night, but probably on Thursday morning to assess that, and that will be the signal for the other Ministers to go to their national parliaments. This is not valid for all ministers, but I believe six or seven have to go to national parliaments. Myself, I have to go. And that can take place on Thursday and Friday. And hopefully at the end of the week we will have another conference call, formally to give the mandate to the institutions. And they will enter into a process to decide an MOU, which is the basis, and the financing arrangements which are the basis, for a new ESM programme. Of course, this is a completely different situation to what we were talking about before; the old talks were broken off and the referendum was called. Then we were talking about a short-term extension of the second programme. Now we are talking about designing a completely new programme for three years. It will involve a lot more on substance, commitments and financing needs, and it will take time to negotiate that; we have asked the institutions to do that as quickly as possible, but it will probably be closer to 4 weeks than 2 weeks. That is my understanding and some call me an optimist. So the path for this week is clear: if all goes well we will have two conference calls to further set off the process. There is already for next week outlined two issues of further legislation for the Greek parliament to consider. Two other issues: prior actions to take forward. And that way we hope to make a lot of progress on measures and reforms that are necessary, while we are finalising the MOU. 
Today we also looked at the issue of bridge financing, because of course there are urgent needs. And this process of finalising the agreement will take time. This is very complex. We looked at  a number of possibilities. There are technical, legal, financial and political issues to consider. So we have tasked an ad hoc working group, technical experts to look into that. They have already started today and they will continue their work tonight. Tomorrow, the Euro Working Group will look at it. That is the deputy-ministers, as you know, and then we will probably have a conference call of ministers on specifically this issue to see what solutions we can find. It is very complex. We haven't yet found the golden key to solve that issue. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,08.14.2015,"Good evening and welcome to this press conference. We have just finished the Eurogroup meeting and we've come to a positive conclusion on the proposals by the institutions. All the intense work of the last week has paid off and let me here also extend my thanks to the teams of the institutions and the team of the Greek government that had worked so hard these last months to reach an agreement. We also have reached agreement at the political level in the Eurogroup. We had a very constructive and good atmosphere. Of course there were differences, but we have managed to solve the last issues. We have issued a statement outlining the details of our agreement. I will therefore mention only the main elements. 
First, we welcomed the agreement that was reached between Greece and the institutions on policy conditionality. It is to our mind in line with the key objectives set by the euro summit on 12 July, and if implemented with determination -- of course it always boils down to determination -- it will allow the Greek economy to return to sustainable growth. 
Secondly, we commended the Greek authorities on the strong commitment shown in the last weeks in the normalisation of working methods with the institutions. I think that was very helpful to have a good and fruitful process and also we've seen important and determined legislative steps over the past weeks and days even, in Greece, and that has helped in the process of rebuilding trust; and many of the colleagues in the Eurogroup made that point. 
Thirdly, on the policy conditionality, we welcomed the broad scope of the policy measures contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), as agreed. It's a comprehensive and ambitious reform package, it addresses the main challenges both on reaching sound public finances to return to growth, but also structural policy frameworks to enhance competitiveness. And finally it safeguards financial stability; it deals with the issues with the banks. 
On the latter point, there will be later this year, this autumn, an asset quality review and stress test, and on the basis of that, recapitalisation will take place. In that process the bail-in instrument will apply for senior bondholders, whereas the bail-in of depositors is explicitly excluded. You will find this in our statement. 
Fourthly, the Eurogroup underlined that a significantly strengthened privatisation programme is a part of the new ESM programme. Therefore it is important that the independent fund which will be set up will be established in Greece at the latest by end-2015. It will be under the supervision of the relevant European institutions. It will take on board the privatisation of state assets and the proceeds of this fund will, for the first €25 billion, completely be used to repay debt and for the second part of the target of €50 billion, it will be 50/50: 50% to repay debt and 50% can be reinvested. This fund will be set up before the end of the year. Proposals have to be made already at the latest by end October 2015. The ownership of this fund will be transferred as soon as possible after the recapitalisation of the banks has taken place later this year. 
Fifth, on prior actions. We welcomed, as I already said, the comprehensive set of prior actions that has been legislated by the Greek authorities. The most recent prior actions legislated have been positively assessed by the institutions and I think this demonstrates that programme ownership has been picked up seriously and constructively by the Greek government. 
The overall financing envelope of the agreed ESM programme will amount to €86 billion. This includes a €25 billion bank buffer, which can be available if needed to address potential bank recapitalisation and resolution costs. This money will, later on, after the first review as I said, be transferred to segregated account in the ESM. Whether it is needed will be decided of course after the assessment of the banks and the stress test later this year. 
On debt sustainability - and this is of course the key issue - a debt sustainability assessment has been provided by the Commission, in a strong liaison with the ECB. The analysis basically concludes that debt sustainability can be achieved through a far-reaching and credible reform programme -- I think we have that in front of us -- and debt-related measures without nominal haircuts, because that was made explicit in the euro summit statement of 12 July. The Eurogroup stands ready to consider, after the positive completion of the first programme review, possible additional measures to ensure gross financing needs remaining at a sustainable level. “Gross financing needs” is the debt service approach that we will take when we look at the debt sustainability. We will do that after the successful completion of the first review. 
Finally, we welcomed the intention of the IMF Board to consider further financial support for Greece. They will do so in the autumn. We stressed that such IMF involvement for the Eurogroup is indispensable. We welcomed the positive assessment of IMF staff of the policy conditionality contained in the MoU. For the IMF Board to consider further financial support, there are two issues that are crucial and we realise and accept that. First of all there needs to be a full specification of fiscal, structural and financial sector reforms; and secondly that debt sustainability is ensured. On those reforms, just to mention one is the pension reform and we have again underlined that at the latest in October there has to be clarity on those pension reforms from the side of the Greek government, in agreement with the institutions. 
Finally, as regards the next steps, the necessary elements are all in place now to launch the relevant national procedures to get the formal approval of the ESM financial assistance programme. We expect that the ESM Board of Governors which will take the formal decision will be in a position to approve the proposal on Wednesday, 19 August, by the end of the day; and that it would also unlock the initial fist tranche of the programme. 
That will be all from me. I will now give the floor to Vice-President Dombrovskis and to Klaus Regling.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem,09.12.2015,"Good evening and welcome to this press conference. We have just finished the Eurogroup meeting and we've come to a positive conclusion on the proposals by the institutions. All the intense work of the last week has paid off and let me here also extend my thanks to the teams of the institutions and the team of the Greek government that had worked so hard these last months to reach an agreement. We also have reached agreement at the political level in the Eurogroup. We had a very constructive and good atmosphere. Of course there were differences, but we have managed to solve the last issues. We have issued a statement outlining the details of our agreement. I will therefore mention only the main elements. 
First, we welcomed the agreement that was reached between Greece and the institutions on policy conditionality. It is to our mind in line with the key objectives set by the euro summit on 12 July, and if implemented with determination -- of course it always boils down to determination -- it will allow the Greek economy to return to sustainable growth. 
Secondly, we commended the Greek authorities on the strong commitment shown in the last weeks in the normalisation of working methods with the institutions. I think that was very helpful to have a good and fruitful process and also we've seen important and determined legislative steps over the past weeks and days even, in Greece, and that has helped in the process of rebuilding trust; and many of the colleagues in the Eurogroup made that point.

"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,09.12.2015,"Good afternoon and welcome to this press conference. We briefly discussed the economic situation in the Eurozone, I will let Commissioner Moscovici say more about that. We had a follow-up discussion on the issue of structural reforms, in particular on the tax wedge on labour, which is becoming a test case for us on how we can strengthen our cooperation in the field of structural reforms, how can we push the reform agenda jointly in the Eurozone.
Today we discussed and have decided to develop the instrument of benchmarking for the tax burden on labour to follow and stimulate developments in countries of the Eurozone on this issue.
It has to do with competitiveness and the functioning of the labour market, and there is a lot of potential there for us to improve. We will both benchmark on the EU average and also closely follow how we do in relation to the OECD average. There is a statement which will be distributed to you on the issue of benchmarking structural reforms and specifically on the tax wedge on labour, so I will refer for time's sake to that statement.
On Greece, we took stock of latest developments, we were informed by our Greek colleague, who is of course part of the caretaker government. He confirmed that preparatory work of the caretaker government is thus continuing and that implementation, for as far as it does not require further parliamentary decisions, will continue. All of that, of course, in order to lose as little time as possible. From our perspective we can of course only respect the democratic process and will await the election results. Timely implementation of reforms and next steps to take, after the election, is of course crucial and time is limited.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,10.05.2015,"The Eurogroup welcomed the Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who has been re-appointed to the post following the elections in Greece on 20 September 2015. The discussion then focused on the way forward in implementing Greece's new economic adjustment programme.
In this context the Eurogroup endorsed the first set of milestones, which Greece needs to implement in order to receive a disbursement of €2 billion. This amount is a sub-tranche of the €3 billion which remain undisbursed from the first tranche of €26 billion, as agreed in the programme.
The Eurogroup encouraged Greece to agree with the institutions on the second set of milestones in the next few weeks. Successful implementation of the second set of milestones would unlock the disbursement of the remaining €1 billion.

The Eurogroup called upon Greek authorities to cooperate closely and constructively with the institutions in order to complete the first review of implementation of the programme successfully and swiftly.

The first review is expected to begin in October 2015.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,11.09.2015,"The second issue on our agenda was Greece. We were informed by the Commission, the ECB and the IMF on the state of play, and by the ESM. A lot of progress and work has been done in terms of programme implementation, further development and it has been a very cooperative process. This has been emphasised by all sides. So that was very good news.
We've also taken stock of the ongoing recapitalisation exercise with Greek banks. There too a lot of work has been done and the size of the recapitalisation is smaller than expected earlier, and actually the speed of the process is also going quite smoothly so far. The next thing to do is to have all the financial sector measures in place before the completion of the recapitalisation process. Our Greek colleague Efkleidis Tsakalotos gave his commitment to get that done. There are open issues which you may have heard about which have to do with nonperforming loans, and more specifically household insolvency. So more work needs to be done to get an agreement also on those issues. Implementation needs to be finished over the course of the coming week. All of that is necessary to finalise the process of the recapitalisation. As you remember €10 billion has already been put in a segregated account in the ESM, which is ready if needed and when needed for the recapitalisation process, but of course the agreed conditions need to be met.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,11.23.2015,"We had a extra dedicated Eurogroup meeting today to talk about Draft Budgetary Plans (DBP) and we also took stock of the discussions on Greece. Of course all this happened under the dark cloud of the migration issue and on the top of all that - the terrorism attacks in Paris and the acute situation here in Brussels. I am happy that we could meet today and that we didn't have to call it off. I think that's a good signal and I want to express my strong appreciation for the Belgian authorities for keeping us safe today. 
First on Greece. Before the Eurogroup, a Board of Directors of the ESM meeting took place to take the formal decision on disbursement. There are two elements here, first of all of course there is this situation with the first set of milestones which now have been implemented. One issue has been moved on to the second set of milestones which is linked to the pension reform, but all the other issues have been dealt with and that opens up the possibility to transfer the €2 billion disbursement. Connected to that is of course the money reserved for the recapitalization of the banks. The formal decision on the transfer of the required funds for the recapitalisation of banks will be taken by the ESM Board of Directors - we don't know the exact figures yet - following the relevant state aid decision which the Commission will have to take on a case-by-case basis. So we can't prejudge that. 
We made quite clear that the recapitalisation exercise is being carried out the way that we have agreed, so in line with BRRD but also in line with the Eurogroup statement of 14 August 2015.
We underlined that the precautionary recapitalisations are of a temporary nature and the proceeds stemming from the future disposal of the HFSF participations will be used to repay the ESM as soon as such proceeds become available. I think those were some of the key elements we underlined today in our discussion. Also an important point is the strong implementation of the NPL strategy. This is crucial for the success of the whole recapitalisation process. It is also crucial for and was underlined by the IMF. The IMF participated in our meeting today via telephone. The process of the coming weeks will focus of course on the actual implementation of the recapitalisation process but also on designing the second set of milestones. The EWG will already this week continue to work on that and we have welcomed the commitment by the Greek authorities that they will implement the second set of milestones by mid-December 2015 as well as take all necessary decisions needed to remove bottlenecks on key projects co-funded by the EU and the EIB. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,12.07.2015,"Let me first make a couple of remarks on Greece, which was one of the countries discussed today. After successful implementation of the first set of milestones last month, today we took stock of the implementation of the second set of milestones. Which as you know are connected to the last sub-tranche of €1 bn. The design of the second set has been agreed by the EWG at the end of November. We called on the Greek authorities to implement these milestones as soon as possible and as agreed. The objective is to settle this by mid-December, so that we can focus on some of the major fiscal and structural reforms that are still open and need to be finalised for the first review early next year.  
Recapitalisation of the four significant banks is almost finalised. We expect the last disbursement to be made tomorrow after approval of the ESM Board of Directors. Overall, a good success with significant involvement from private investors. The exercise will cost the programme less than €5½ bn, well below, as you know, initial estimates.  
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,01.14.2016,"The third point I want to make is about Greece. We discussed the next steps and took stock of where we are on the ESM programme. Significant progress, a lot has been achieved after the summer of course. Specifically before the end of the year on the banking sector, where as you remember roughly €5bn was put into the banks, which is a much lower number than we initially had expected. We are now entering a new phase of the programme, working towards the first review - the completion of the first review I should say - which is of course critical as it deals with a number of open fiscal issues, but also structural measures such as the pension reform. It is of decisive importance for the overall success of the programme and essential to get Greece's economic recovery back on track. So in our discussions we did not go into depth into for example the pension reform proposal, we just took stock of where we are in the process. The institutions have put a number of questions on more detailed information to the Greek government. We stress the importance to have that exchange of information very quickly, so that the institutions can travel to Athens to start the work there on the review in a very short period. And then we will take stock of the situation at our next meeting in February 2016. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,02.11.2016,"We then moved to Greece. We discussed the state of play of the first review of the ESM programme, following the visit of mission chiefs to Athens last week. This important review deals with the key fiscal and structural measures. We were informed that there is good cooperation, a lot of ground has been covered, progress achieved on important issues, but further work is still needed in a number of areas before a staff-level agreement can be reached.
We called on both the Greek authorities and the institutions to pursue the discussions on the review further, in particular on items such as pension reform, the fiscal issues and the privatisation fund, with a view to reaching that staff-level agreement.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,03.07.2016,"The first topic on our agenda was Greece. We discussed the state of play, in particular of course of the first review, what the next steps could be. The outcome of that is that the mission chiefs will return to Athens. I'm not sure when exactly, perhaps already tomorrow. There is enough common ground, enough preparation has been done for their mission to continue, hopefully to work towards a successful completion. We realise that if we want to complete, fully comply to what has been agreed this summer, more work will have to be done. So the first outcome of the Eurogroup today is that the mission chiefs will return to Athens, the second one is that we stressed that more work needs to be done, more effort needs to be put in for that to be a good outcome. There are still fiscal gaps to be filled and some of the reforms will have to be deepened.
So we called on both the institutions but specifically also on the Greek government to deliver that extra effort. On their return, which of course we don't know when that will be, we will have to take a political decision which also concerns the issue of debt and debt management, debt relief. As you know, we have a longstanding promise that if the Greek government fulfils its commitments in the programme and delivers a primary surplus, we will do what is necessary to make the annual debt surplus manageable, and that today also in Eurogroup we have realised and made explicit that that discussion is going to be on our table in the near future. So we will seriously try to bring those work strands together in the coming months. So that's where we are on Greece and work will continue. We have a joint interest to do it as quickly as possible.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,04.22.2016,"Having said that, and on that positive note, let's first turn to Greece, which took up a major part of our time today. We discussed the state of play of the first review of the ESM programme and next steps to be taken.
Cooperation between the institutions and the Greek authorities has been strong and productive, but the institutions will say more about that. We believe that substantial progress has been made, reducing the number of open issues, and getting close to an agreement on a number of key areas such as pension reform, income tax reform, the NPL strategy and the establishment of the privatisation fund. On some issues more work will have to be done to fully conclude that, but we are very close.
Today we also looked at and clarified the way to go forward to bridge the issue which is about insecurity of a forecast and confidence that we can have in the implementation of what has been agreed.
We came to the conclusion that the policy package should include a contingent package of additional measures that would be implemented only if necessary to reach the primary surplus target for 2018. The contingency mechanism needs to be credible, legislated upfront, automatic and be based on objective factors which would trigger these contingent measures.
That needs further work: the design of that, how it would work, what kind of measures there would be and what would trigger it. I'm happy to say that with the commitment of the Greek minister to work on that constructively and as quickly as possible, the institutions have said that they stand ready to work as quickly as possible, in the coming days, on this contingency mechanism. On that basis, if we have the package which needs to be done and delivered upfront, and if we have the contingency package and the mechanism to support that, we can have a further Eurogroup next Thursday. This is not for sure yet, but we are aiming for a meeting next Thursday which would then come to positive conclusions on those two elements, on the upfront package and the contingency package, and have a serious discussion on debt sustainability. As you know we have a long standing promise which was reaffirmed during the summer agreement, that if necessary and on condition that the Greek government fully delivers on what has been agreed in the programme, if necessary, we stand ready to consider more measures to assure debt sustainability.
Ministers today have given us a mandate to work on that, to make the analysis, and to prepare possibilities within, of course, some limitations. To mention two main ones: there is no support in the Eurogroup for nominal haircuts on the debt, and what we will design and propose needs to stay within the agreement of last summer. So we will look at possibilities of re-profiling and if necessary possible additional measures, looking at maturities and grace periods as outlined in the agreement last summer. And hopefully we will meet again next Thursday to bring those elements all together and come to a political agreement which would be very important for Greece and for the Eurozone.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,05.09.2016,"We had an extra Eurogroup specially on the Greek programme. We discussed basically three topics: one is the policy package coming from the agreement which we achieved last summer; second, an additional contingency mechanism and third we had a first discussion on debt and sustainability and what needs to be done there.
So first, on the package the Eurogroup welcomed the agreement that was achieved on the policy package that should now lay the way for the successful completion of the first review of this programme. The first review includes also the implementation of the NPL strategy and the privatization programme. But the core of that package is the pension reform, personal income tax reform and additional fiscal parametric measures. Some of them have been legislated last night in the Greek parliament and the institutions will now complete this part of the process to assess whether everything is in accord with the agreement and to finalize also on the basis of further discussion the additional contingency mechanism.
So a few words on that mechanism: it will be legislated up front; it will ensure that, when necessary on an objective basis, Greece fails to meet the annual primary surplus target in the programme, automatically this mechanism will come into place. It will look at expenditure measures, including non-discretionary measures that can be replaced, at a later time, by structural measures to make sure that the programme, the budget, is structurally back on track and in that structural approach also revenue measures can be put in place.
So, what we did on the contingency mechanism is basically take the last proposal from the Greek government and force it, in our discussions today, to make sure that there is the option of permanent structural measures, agreed with the institutions, including revenue measures which could become effective in the year thereafter. So this is an addition, an amendment to the Greek proposal.
The privatisation programme is also part of the first review we have put in our conclusions today. The Supervisory Board of this Privatisation and Investment Fund will be appointed by June 2016 and the fund will become fully operational not later than September this year.
Then on debt we had a first round of discussion, looking at the necessity, the timing, the design and the conditionality of debt relief measures. Of course, any measures will be    conditioned upon full completion, full implementation of the measures agreed in the programme and will be considered later on. There were no decisions today.
We agreed on a number of guiding principles: why are we doing this, why are we looking at further debt measures, of course to facilitate, to make it easier for Greece to gain access to the markets again, to smoothen the repayment profile in the coming years, to incentivise the country's adjustment process and to accommodate uncertain GDP growth and interest rate developments in the future.
What we will do in the coming weeks -- the EWG will be asked to do that work with the experts -- is to design and establish a benchmark according to which under the baseline scenario of a debt sustainability analysis Greece's gross financing needs should remain on a sustainable path. So if you remember, in 2012 we talked about having a cut or reducing the debt to GDP in a percentage which changes basically the method when looking at the annual debt burden and annual debt service. And we need to make, to develop that method and create a benchmark for it. So that's the first thing that the technical people will have to do.
And then, in today's meeting we discussed the way forward; we foresee a sequence approach: what we could do in the short term, the medium term and the long term. For the short term, it is basically about possibilities to optimize debt management, so the total debt could be further optimized, reducing the cost for the Greek side, making it more manageable in the future. For the medium term, we ask the EWG to explore specific measures, such as (they were already mentioned last summer) longer grace and payment periods, specific measures which can be used if necessary at the end of the programme, so no earlier than 2018. And there were two: one specific point that was mentioned and we will ask the EWG to look at it, and it is the use of SMP and ANFA profits. So this is about what could come into effect at the end of the programme in 2018: specific measures to reduce debt. And the third layer is for the long term: the Eurogroup stands ready, if necessary, and conditional upon compliance with the primary surplus targets, to further assess at the end of the programme the need for possible additional debt measures. So this is at the end of the programme: we will also look ahead and see what could be needed, what approach could be needed to make sure that also in the coming decades Greece stays on track also in terms of debt sustainability. That is a decision to be taken at the end of the programme in 2018. The EWG has a mandate to work further on the technicalities of these three approaches: short term, medium term and long term, and together with the agreement and the implementation of the policy package, this agreement on debt we are going to try to achieve in the next Eurogroup. This agreement on debt and adequate financing assurances by the European partners are expected to allow the IMF to participate in the programme.
Finally, on the outcome of today's meeting, we have, so to speak, two work strands ahead of us: one is to complete all the measures in the short term package and make sure everything is done as agreed, and that could then lead, after a number of procedural steps, to the next disbursement to Greece; and the other work track is, as I said, the EWG would do technical work on debt measures in short term, medium term and long term. So we have two work strands ahead of us and we will meet again in the regular Eurogroup on 24 May and discuss all these issues once again.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,05.25.2016,"Good evening and welcome to this press conference. 
The main topic of today's Eurogroup was of course Greece, so I will concentrate on that. We've reached a full staff-level agreement; well actually, the institutions and Greece had already reached the full staff-level agreement and that was welcomed and agreed and adhered to by the Eurogroup today. So on the package of all these major reforms that Greece had committed to last summer - we have now a full agreement, a lot of legislative work has been done by the Greek government and the institutions will do a final check on that to look at the last legislative work and to see whether that's all in agreement. Part of that is of course the contingency mechanism that makes sure that Greece stays on the fiscal path. 
On that basis and of the full implementation of those prior actions and the completion of the national procedures, the ESM will be able to endorse the supplementary MOU and then approve the disbursement of the 2nd tranche of this programme. The figure that we have outlined for that is €10.3 billion, to be disbursed in several disbursements but perhaps I'll leave it to Klaus to outline how that works both in substance and in procedure. So this is very good news, already this part of the agreement of today is very good news because it shows that the programme is fully back on track and that Greece has done a lot and is delivering a lot and we are making good progress there. 
Of course this should lead to a full and positive conclusion of the first review, and as you remember, on that basis we've promised to look at debt and discuss debt sustainability. And we did. We prepared that in a couple of Eurogroups behind us already when we said we would discuss it, when we said we had agreed on the method to look at gross financing needs on an annual basis to take as a standard the maximum of 15% of GDP and in the future, once the debt has gone down, that can go to 20%. So on the methodology we already have agreement. We also already agreed in the previous Eurogroup to take it step by step, so we have designed and agreed today a number of measures that can be taken on in the short run. We have a number of measures already for the medium term, if and when needed, and we have designed an additional mechanism for the long term. Let me give you little more information on that. 
The short term is basically a debt management so we've asked the ESM management to look at the measures, which have to do with repayment profiles, which have to do with reducing interest rate risks and which also outline a waiver of the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche which was in the second Greek programme. So along those lines we've asked the ESM management to see what is possible and to take decisions on that in the short run and to take that on. 
It's difficult now and of course Klaus now probably will say more about what in economic terms the impact of that will be, but that is yet to be developed further by the ESM management. 
For the medium term -- this is a second term of measures -- will come into play upon the full implementation of the programme, so this is mid-2018, and the programme runs until July 2018 to be precise. If all is implemented and the programme has come to a successful end, we intend to do more along the following lines to abolish the step-up interest rate margin to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme as of 2018 and the following years. It is the same measure that was also in the short-term package, but then it was only for 2017 so we will continue that measure for the longer term. 
A second element here is the use of the SMP profits and the restoration. If you remember, this was also the part of the second programme where we agreed to return the SMP profits and the profits from ANFA holdings to Greece. When the programme got into trouble in 2014, that stopped, the transfer of these profits. Some are still in the segregated account at the ESM in Luxembourg, that's the 2014 June tranche, so that will be made available. And as of budget year 2017, we will restart this transfer of ANFA and SMP profits to Greece. 
A third element in the medium term package: liability management, where we will consider early partial repayment of existing official loans to Greece. Utilizing unused resources within the ESM programme. To be a little more precise, you remember that part of this programme last summer: we reserved €25 billion for the recapitalization of banks; a lot less was needed -- roughly €5 billion -- so there's €20 billion so far unused. Part of that we will set aside for possible future problems in banks, but the larger part of that could be made available and used to swap existing official loans to Greece in order to reduce the interest rate costs or extend maturities. 
A final element in the medium term package is targeted EFSF re-profiling: that could be extension of weighted average maturities re-profiling of EFSF amortization, as well as capping and deferral of the interest payments. And here we will make sure that we don't incur any additional costs for former programme countries or to the EFSF. 
Then finally for the long term we've agreed to put in place a mechanism, which if needed and activated by the Eurogroup could provide additional debt measures to meet the gross financing benchmarks if it were to be a problem in the future. Of course, as you know, the whole loan package has a long maturity period so we also need to consider the longer period ahead. All of this of course under the agreement that Greece complies with the requirements of our fiscal frameworks. 
Now having said that, the key issue that will certainly interest you is whether the IMF is coming on board and tonight I am very glad to be able to say that the IMF has expressed its intention to recommend to the Fund's board to approve the financial arrangement before the end of the year. So the IMF will go to the board on the basis of this agreement to be part again of the support programme for Greece. Of course this requires a number of steps still to be taken. I will mention just two -- one is of course that before the IMF goes to the board we have a new DSA, to assess where we are, take into account all that is in this agreement and the IMF will of course assess the possible debt relief measures that we, the Eurogroup members, agreed tonight. So those are two key issues that IMF will have to assess before taking that board decision. 
The possible debt relief -- mainly talking about the medium-term package -- will be delivered at the end of the programme, so we are talking mid-2018. The scope will be determined by the Eurogroup on the basis of a revised DSA which will be designed in cooperation with European institutions, also taking into account the European fiscal policy framework -- and this is an important point brought by a number of ministers and also by Klaus -- that of course even after the programme, Greece will, as all Eurogroup members, remain under supervision for its fiscal policies by the Commission. So that is an important element also to take into consideration when we look at the future. 
On that basis we look forward to not just the successful completion of the first review, but also the intention of the IMF management to go to the board. I think this is an important moment in the long Greek programme -- an important moment for all of us since last summer when we had a major crisis of confidence between us -- that confidence has begun to recover. I think that this helped us very much in this Eurogroup and in the last Eurogroups, starting to talk about where we are in the programmes, talk about what is further needed to support Greece, also looking at its debt. And I want to extend my thanks to also to the Greek finance minister and his staff; they have been working very constructively, very seriously, with us, with the institutions, to get us where we are now and I think that is a new phase that I welcome very much.

Jeroen Dijsselbloem,09.09.2016,"Today we discussed first of all the state of affairs in Greece. We took stock of the progress. There are number of milestones still pending to fully complete the first review and coupled with those are further disbursements. So we took stock of those and heard a little about the issues at stake. There was a general feeling that we must not lose time - the time scale that was drawn up and agreed in May 2016 - so more progress is needed and we strongly encouraged the Greek government as a whole to speed up the implementation of the remaining milestones. That of course could also help in ensuring a timely start and completion of the second review. The work on that will have to start very soon also. Against this background, we were happy to hear from our Greek colleague his commitment to do that work very quickly. We will be following  that closely in the coming weeks.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,10.10.2016,"Today we first of all had a discussion on Greece.
We heard from the four institutions on the completion of the implementation of the 15 open milestones which enables us all to close the first review. Important reforms have been undertaken on pensions, energy sector, bank governance, as well as on the setting up of the privatisation fund and the revenue agency. We have issued a statement on that so I can be brief.
This progress enables the ESM to disburse EUR 1.1 bn remaining under the second tranche.
There has also been substantial progress on arrears clearance in July and August, which is essential to strengthen the economic recovery. Technical work will continue to gather the September data. This always takes a number of weeks to complete these data, so that cannot be helped, it cannot be done faster. We hope and presume that before the end of October those data are available. They will then be assessed by the institutions and on that basis the ESM Board of Directors could decide on the disbursement of EUR 1.7 bn. So this is specifically for the clearance of arrears. So that's also good news.
We will now focus on the second review, which we expect to be completed swiftly and we will come back to that in next meetings.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,11.07.2017,"Then Greece. We briefly took stock of the current situation. The second review is ongoing as you know, cooperation between institutions and the Greek authorities is reported to be fruitful. Progress is being made. Obviously it's in everyone's interest to finalise the second review as soon as possible. At the next meeting of the Eurogroup we will spend more time on Greece. This will be on the 5 December, when we will know more about the work the ESM is doing on the possible debt relief measures for the short term. We will hear more from the ongoing 2nd review to get more sense of some of the important reforms that are part of that. Labour market reform, social system reform, the fiscal trajectory for the coming years, particularly the next years budget and the 2018 budget. All of those works strands will come together at the beginning of December and we will spend some time on that. Of course, with a view on the IMF going to the board before the end of the year which, Poul Thomsen reconfirmed today at the meeting, is still their strong intention. 
We were also debriefed on the state of play on technical assistance to Greece, but I will leave that up to Pierre if he wishes to say more. It was a positive report and we are very grateful to the Commission and the staff of the Commission for all the work done in collaboration with member states. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,12.05.2017,"Good evening and welcome to the second press conference after the regular Eurogroup, which was mostly about Greece. We were informed by the institutions on the on-going work to reach a full staff-level agreement between Greece and the institutions. It was clear that more work has to be done. The institutions are prepared and stand ready to return to Athens to work on it. That is the state of play.  
The second part of our discussion was about debt relief, in particular about the short term package. As you remember in May 2016, we reached an agreement on the way forward on debt sustainability. We distinguished short term measures which the ESM, within its mandate, could design and implement, and medium term measures which we are ready to use, if and when necessary, at the end of the programme (the second half of 2018).  
Today we heard from Klaus Regling what the short term measures consist of, and he will go into that in detail in a minute, but first I will give the floor to the Commissioner.  
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,01.26.2017,"Second let me talk about Greece. We were first debriefed by the ESM on the implementation of the short term debt measures. I am sure Klaus Regling would say more about that.
Then we were informed by the institutions on the state of play of the second review. The good news is that the Greek economy is recovering faster than anyone expected. There are also strong dynamics on the fiscal side, with better than expected revenues. We have also heard that Greece is set to over perform its 2016 fiscal target.
And there is a clear understanding that a quick finalisation of the second review is in everyone's interest and will continue to support the positive trend in the economy.
The institutions and the Greek authorities will remain engaged in constructive discussions to solve the outstanding issues. We have encouraged them to accelerate that work, with a view to a quick return of the mission to Athens and reach a staff level agreement as soon as possible.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,02.20.2017,"Let me come quickly to the topic that probably interests you most today which is Greece. 
We have intensified talks in the last week, week and a half, with the institutions and the Greek government, to find enough common ground for the institutions to go back to Athens. The outcome of today is that they will go back to Athens in a very short time. They will work with the Greek authorities on the additional package of structural reforms; looking at the tax system, the pensions system, also labour market regulation. There will be a change in the policy mix, moving away from austerity and putting more emphasis on deep reforms, which has also been a key element for the IMF. So that is I think a good step and we have to realize that there is no agreement, there is no political agreement at this point, as that would be too early. It is a very positive and good step that the institutions have enough confidence and a common agreement to go back to Athens. 
A lot of work still needs to be done. I already mentioned the kind of reforms that it's about. In any country the combination of these topics would be difficult, so we will allow the institutions and the Greek government to do that work on the ground in more technical detail. 
And they will return to the Eurogroup if and when there is a staff level agreement and then we will have a final political discussion on the latest stages of the programme, on how to move forward. 
So, very happy with that outcome for today. Broad support, institutions willing and ready to go, and we hope to come back to you as soon as possible. 
On that element of time, because I know you will be asking about that, there is no liquidity issue in the short run for Greece. But I think we all feel a sense of urgency because of the key issue of confidence. If you want economic growth in Greece to continue and to start picking up, confidence is a key factor. That confidence has been returning in the last year and needs to strengthen, and we don't want to jeopardize that. So that would be a strong motivator to do the work as soon as possible.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,03.20.2017,"Let me start with our discussion on Greece. We were debriefed by the institutions and the Greek authorities on the state of play of the ongoing second review. I think a lot of work has been done and progress made. But still some issues remain - some key issues - and the outcome of today's meeting is that on the basis of the preparatory meeting which we had - myself, the institutions and the Greek authorities - we agreed that talks will continue to intensify in the coming days here in Brussels, focusing on the key outstanding topics which I hope are limited, to try to clear those big issues out of the way and come to a full policy package agreement. And then we can have the political discussion in the Eurogroup.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,04.07.2017,"Let me start with Greece. We have achieved significant progress on the second review since the last Eurogroup in March. As you remember, then, on my initiative, we had changed the strategy, we had changed the order of things and we had intensified talks to, first of all, reach an agreement between the institutions and the Greek government on the key elements, the overarching elements, of the policy package, let's say the big reforms, and once that was achieved, to finalise details and solve the remaining smaller issues. We have been successful in doing so. So that is the news I can bring you today. We have an agreement on those overarching elements of policy, in terms of size, timing and sequencing of the reforms, and on that basis, further work will continue in the coming days, with a view for the mission to return as soon as possible to Athens to complete the work. 
Let me give you some headlines. We have agreed on a 2% reform package, 1% in 2019 mainly based on pensions, 1% in 2020 in principle, mainly based on personal income tax. And we agreed that the Greek government can also, in parallel, legislate expansionary measures, on the assumption that the economy is doing better and the fiscal path is doing better than expected, and using the fiscal space that then will be created by these additional reforms. 
We invite the institutions and the Greek authorities to continue the work putting the last dots on the ""i's"" and to reach a full Staff Level Agreement as soon as possible. 
Once a Staff Level Agreement is reached, the Eurogroup will come back to the issue of the medium-term fiscal path for the post-programme period and debt sustainability, building on what we have already agreed in May 2016, in order to reach that overall political agreement. And it is very important for Greece that we do this as soon as possible. But, as we said, the big blocks have now been sorted out and that should allow us to speed up and go for the final stretch. 
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,06.22.2017,"I will only speak about Greece, because I think it is the only topic of interest to you tonight. We have made huge progress on the policy package on which so much work had been done in the last months and on which an agreement had been reached between Greece and the institutions. The Eurogroup, of course, welcomed that very much. We are also very positive on the work done in Greece to implement those agreed measures and reforms in prior actions. The Commissioner will say more about that, but a lot of work has already been done in Greece by the Greek government and they are committed to continue that work as soon as possible, so that we can work towards that next disbursement before the summer. 
Having said that, on debt sustainability, we have always said that if there was an agreement on the second review - and I think we are close to formally closing the second review, with a positive outcome - if there is agreement on that, that would open up the debt discussion to see where we are in terms of debt sustainability. This afternoon and this evening we had a first in-depth discussion on the topic of debt sustainability, looking very carefully at needs, options, constraints. But at this point, we have not reached an overall agreement on that part of our discussion. In the coming weeks, we will continue our work on that. We will try to come to an definite conclusion in the next Eurogroup meeting which will be in 3 weeks time. We will use that time well to work hard with the institutions and all member states involved. 
The Eurogroup today has made quite clear that it is ready and prepared to specify further what could be envisaged if needed, in terms of debt relief. Of course, there are two guiding principles for the Eurogroup: that it needs to be inside the package that we had already agreed on 16 May, and that the final decision on what is actually needed and will be put in place, in terms of debt relief, will be taken at the end of the programme. 
The IMF today also made it clear that they welcomed very much the progress made. They are impressed by the reforms and the work done by the Greeks and they still stand ready to go to the board. But they will also wait for the final discussion that we hope to have in 3 weeks time, in the next Eurogroup, on the issue of debt.
So overall - positive developments from Greece, lots of work done tonight. I think we are very close to that agreement. But tonight, we were unable to close a possible gap between what could be done and what some of us had expected should or could be done. We need to close that by looking at the additional options or by adjusting our expectations. Both are possible, and perhaps both should be done. That I think will surely bring us to a more positive and definite conclusion at the next Eurogroup, in June.
"
Jeroen Dijsselbloem,06.15.2017,"Our meeting revolved mainly around Greece, and was a crucial one for the programme. I am glad to announce that we have achieved an agreement on all elements: conditionality, debt strategy moving forward and IMF participation. Christine Lagarde will speak about that.
We have issued a statement. I will therefore only present the key elements.
First, we welcomed the ambitious policy package that was fully agreed between Greece and the institutions and the adoption of the agreed prior actions for the second review.
The fiscal measures for the post-programme period that have been adopted address the underlying structural imbalances in Greek public finances. Decisive steps have also been taken to reduce NPLs and to operationalise the privatisation and investment fund.
The policy package also contains a large number of reforms to increase potential  growth of the Greek economy, whilst at the same time reinforcing the social safety net. The labour and product market reforms, along with the enhanced use of EU structural funds, technical assistance and growth initiatives, will enable Greece to return to a sustainable growth path. For this purpose, the Greek authorities helped while the European institutions will work on the creation of a National Development Bank, as well as measures to spur investment.
Second, the Eurogroup discussed the debt strategy for Greece on the basis of the agreement of May 2016, last year's agreement.
It is, first of all, essential that public finances in Greece remain on a solid track. The Greek authorities committed to maintain a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP until 2022 and a fiscal trajectory after that, that is consistent with its commitments under the European fiscal framework thereafter.
The Eurogroup also specified further the medium term debt measures that were already in the May 2016 statement, which it stands ready to implement at the end of the programme. We confirmed that we are ready to consider a further extension of the weighted average maturities and a further deferral of EFSF interest and amortization, both up to 15 years.
In addition, we also stand ready to implement an operational growth adjustment mechanism to adjust the EFSF loan re-profiling should growth developments in the post-programme period differ from what will be expected at the end of the programme in 2018. In other words, if there is more growth, then more or faster repayment of loans can take place; if growth is less; then further lengthening or further deferral of interest could take place. We have mandated the EWG to work further on this mechanism and it will be part of the decision-making at the end of the programme, part of the medium-term debt package.
As agreed in May last year, these medium-term measures, as well as the growth adjustment mechanism, will be implemented as far as needed at the end of the programme, conditional upon its successful implementation. That is the standard language and that is still valid. The exact calibration of these measures will also be confirmed at the end of the programme on the basis of an updated DSA delivered by the IMF, in cooperation with the European institutions.
For the long term, the Eurogroup recalled the agreement that in the case of an unexpectedly more adverse scenario, an additional contingency mechanism on debt could be activated. In other words, the Eurogroup reiterated its commitment to continue to support Greece in case of a more adverse scenario than now is foreseen.
Finally, against this background, the IMF management will shortly recommend to the board… I'll stop here, this is the kind of text that Christine, I think, would like to use.
As regards the next steps, following national procedures, the ESM governing bodies are expected to approve the disbursement of the third tranche of the ESM programme amounting to a total of €8.5 bn. Klaus Regling will say more about that figure and how it is built up.
Overall, I think this is a major step forward. The Eurogroup commends the institutions, the Greek authorities and, foremost of course, the Greek people for their intense efforts and resolve. We are now going into the last year of the financial support programme for Greece. We will prepare an exit strategy going forward to enable Greece to stand on its own feet again over the course of next year.
