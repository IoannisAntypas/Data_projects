Klaus Regling,04.22.2016,"A few words on Greece from the ESM perspective: I can confirm what you already heard, that there has been good progress in Athens; there was good cooperation among the institutions, and also with the Greek authorities. And I welcome that there is now an overall agreement on the package of fiscal measures and key structural reforms.
As the data from Eurostat yesterday confirm, the fiscal performance last year was substantially better than expected – that is encouraging. But we have to look into the future, and the future is uncertain. There is not a full agreement on the forecasts; in principle the ESM shares the Commission’s analysis, be we have to admit that looking over a 2-year horizon, uncertainty is high when we make forecasts and therefore I also believe, like the other speakers, that to identify contingencies, as an extra insurance in case something happens unexpectedly, is a useful way to go, and that hopefully can be done in the next few days. That would be the precondition, as the President [of the Eurogroup] said, to look into debt relief, in accordance with the statement by leaders and the Eurogroup last July and August. Because the ESM is by far the largest creditor of Greece, we have a particular interest to find solutions that make Greek debt sustainable, and therefore at the technical level, we are looking into options such as maturity extension or grace periods. But again, as said by President Dijsselbloem, nominal haircuts have again been excluded by everybody in the Eurogroup today.
I hope that all this can be concluded soon, because the liquidity situation is becoming tight; it’s now exactly 4 months ago when we made our last disbursement from the ESM to Greece. There have been and there are debt service payments; more are coming due in the next few months. There is a risk that the government may have to accumulate domestic arrears again, which would be very detrimental for the economic situation, therefore I hope we can make good progress in the next few days and weeks.

Klaus Regling,05.25.2016,"The Eurogroup welcomes that a full staff-level agreement has been reached between Greece and the institutions. Also, the Eurogroup notes with satisfaction that the Greek authorities and the European institutions have reached an agreement on the contingency fiscal mechanism, which is in line with the Eurogroup statement adopted on 9 May in particular as regard the possible adoption of permanent structural measures, including revenue measures, to be agreed with the institutions. It therefore provides further reassurances that Greece will meet the primary surplus targets of the ESM programme (3.5% of GDP in the medium-term), without prejudice to the obligations of Greece under the SGP and the Fiscal Compact. 
The Eurogroup also welcomes the adoption by the Greek parliament of most of the agreed prior actions for the first review, notably the adoption of legislation to deliver fiscal parametric measures amounting to 3% of GDP that should allow to meet the fiscal targets in 2018, to open up the market for the sale of loans and to establish the agreed Greek Privatisation and Investment Fund that should operate in full independence. The Eurogroup mandates the EWG to verify in the next few days the full implementation of the outstanding prior actions on the basis of an assessment by the institutions, in particular the corrections to the legislation on the opening up of the market for the sale of loans, and on the pension reform, as well as the completion of all prior actions related to the government pending actions in the field of privatization. 
Following the full implementation of all prior actions and subject to the completion of national procedures, the ESM governing bodies are expected to endorse the supplemental MoU and approve the disbursement of the second tranche of the ESM programme. The second tranche under the ESM programme amounting to EUR 10.3 bn will be disbursed to Greece in several disbursements, starting with a first disbursement in June (EUR 7.5 bn) to cover debt servicing needs and to allow a clearance of an initial part of arrears as a means to support the real economy. The subsequent disbursements to be used for arrears clearance and further debt servicing needs will be made after the summer. The disbursements for arrears clearance will be subject to a positive reporting by the European Institutions on the clearance of net arrears. The additional disbursement for debt servicing needs will be subject to milestones related to privatization, including the new Privatization and Investment Fund, bank governance, revenue agency and energy sector to be assessed by the European institutions and verified by the EWG and the ESM Board of Directors. 
In line with the 9 May Eurogroup statement, and in view of the forthcoming full implementation of all the prior actions by Greece and completion of the first review, the Eurogroup considered today the sustainability of Greek public debt. 
The Eurogroup agrees to assess debt sustainability with reference to the following benchmark for gross financing needs (GFN): under the baseline scenario, GFN should remain below 15% of GDP during the post programme period for the medium term, and below 20% of GDP thereafter. 
The Eurogroup recalls the medium-term primary surplus target of 3.5% of GDP as of 2018 and underlines the importance of a fiscal trajectory consistent with the fiscal commitments under the EU framework. 
The Eurogroup recalls the following general guiding principles agreed on 9 May for possible additional debt measures: (i) facilitating market access in order to replace over time public financed debt with privately financed debt; (ii) smoothening the repayment profile; (iii) incentivising the country's adjustment process even after the programme ends; and (iv) flexibility to accommodate uncertain GDP growth and interest rate developments in the future. On 9 May the Eurogroup also reconfirmed that nominal haircuts are excluded, and that all measures taken will be in line with existing EU law and the ESM and EFSF legal frameworks. 
Guided by these principles and on the basis of technical work carried out by the EWG, the Eurogroup agreed today on a package of debt measures which will be phased in progressively, as necessary to meet the agreed benchmark on gross financing needs and will be subject to the pre-defined conditionality of the ESM programme. 
For the short-term, the Eurogroup agrees on a first set of measures which will be implemented after the closure of the first review up to the end of the programme and which includes: 
	•	Smoothening the EFSF repayment profile under the current weighted average maturity
	•	Use EFSF/ESM diversified funding strategy to reduce interest rate risk without incurring any additional costs for former programme countries
	•	Waiver of the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme for the year 2017
The Eurogroup asks the EFSF and ESM management to take these measures forward within their mandate, on the basis of preparatory work by the EWG, and where needed to prepare formal decision making by the relevant EFSF and ESM decision-making bodies. The decision on the smoothening of the EFSF repayment profile and the reduction of interest rate risks should be taken as a matter of priority. 
For the medium term, the Eurogroup expects to implement a possible second set of measures following the successful implementation of the ESM programme. These measures will be implemented if an update of the debt sustainability analysis produced by the institutions at the end of the programme shows they are needed to meet the agreed GFN benchmark, subject to a positive assessment from the institutions and the Eurogroup on programme implementation. 
	•	Abolish the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the 2nd Greek programme as of 2018
	•	Use of 2014 SMP profits from the ESM segregated account and the restoration of the transfer of ANFA and SMP profits to Greece (as of budget year 2017) to the ESM segregated account as an ESM internal buffer to reduce future gross financing needs.  
	•	Liability management - early partial repayment of existing official loans to Greece by utilizing unused resources within the ESM programme to reduce interest rate costs and to extend maturities. Due account will be taken of exceptionally high burden of some Member States.
	•	If necessary, some targeted EFSF reprofiling (e.g. extension of the weighted average maturities, re-profiling of the EFSF amortization as well as capping and deferral of interest payments) to the extent needed to keep GFN under the agreed benchmark in order to give comfort to the IMF and without incurring any additional costs for former programme countries or to the EFSF.
For the long-term, the Eurogroup is confident that the implementation of this agreement on the main features for debt measures, together with a successful implementation of the Greek ESM programme and the fulfilment of the primary surplus targets as mentioned above, will bring Greece's public debt back on a sustainable path over the medium to long run and will facilitate a gradual return to market financing. At the same time, the Eurogroup agrees on a contingency mechanism on debt which would be activated after the ESM programme to ensure debt sustainability in the long run in case a more adverse scenario were to materialize. The Eurogroup would consider the activation of the mechanism provided additional debt measures are needed to meet the GFN benchmark defined above and would be subject to a decision by the Eurogroup confirming that Greece complies with the requirements under the SGP. Such mechanism could entail measures such as a further EFSF reprofiling and capping and deferral of interest payments. Also, the Eurogroup commits to long-term technical assistance to boost Greek growth. 
The Eurogroup recognises that over the exceptionally long time horizon of assessing debt sustainability there can be no forecasts, only assumptions, given the sizable degree of uncertainty over macroeconomic developments. 
Against the background of the forthcoming successful completion of the first review and the agreement on debt relief, the Eurogroup welcomes the intention of the IMF management to recommend to the Fund's Executive Board to approve a financial arrangement before the end of 2016 that will support the implementation of the agreed fiscal and structural reforms. It is recognised that, consistent with IMF policies, approval of this arrangement will also be based on a new DSA and the assessment of possible debt relief measures mentioned above. The possible debt relief will be delivered at the end of the programme in mid-2018 and the scope will be determined by the Eurogroup on the basis of a revised DSA in cooperation with the European Institutions for purposes of taking into account the European policy framework, subject to full implementation of the programme. 
The Eurogroup stands ready, in line with usual practice, to support the completion of future reviews provided that the policy package considered today, including the contingency mechanism, is implemented as planned.  The Eurogroup confirms that programme implementation, as well as policy conditionality and targets, will be reviewed regularly based on input from the institutions.

Klaus Regling,10.10.2016,"Let me give you a few more details on the disbursement that we may do in the next few weeks. As you heard, the ministers discussed €2.8 billion that is left out of the second tranche of €10.3 billion. €7.5 billion was disbursed in June. The €2.8 billion as you heard has two parts: one for debt service payment and the other for arrears clearance. The ministers authorised the disbursement of €1.1 billion for debt service payments; the formal agreement for that has to come from the ESM Board of Directors, as usual, but the ministers authorised it politically. The next regular ESM Board of Directors meeting will be in two weeks, and then that decision will be taken.
The second part of €1.7 billion for arrears clearance could be authorised at that meeting also, but it depends if we get the missing information, the missing data, to be sure that the target on net arrears clearance has really been met by the end of September. We know that the money disbursed in July – it was €1.8 billion – that went into a special account earmarked for arrears clearance, has been fully used for the purpose intended, so the €1.8 billion was indeed used for arrears clearance, which is very helpful for the Greek economy, and we have all the data and information. But for net clearance, we need to know whether there have been any new arrears accumulating, so that’s what we are waiting for, and hopefully we will get the information by the time our Board of Directors meet.
Just as a reminder, up to now the ESM has already disbursed €28.9 billion to Greece since the third programme of up to €86 billion was agreed last year. With that, the ESM and its predecessor, the EFSF, have disbursed €171 billion to Greece since 2011. With that, the rescue funds are obviously the largest creditor to Greece, and this provides huge benefits for the Greek economy and the Greek budget – because our loans have long maturities and very low interest rates, less than 1% for instance from the ESM. This provides savings for the Greek budget of over €8 billion every year in saved debt service payments, and that corresponds to about 4.5% of Greek GDP.
 
(response to question on timing of disbursement to Greece)
The Board of Directors have their next regular meeting in two weeks’ time, so it will happen then. We could do it earlier, but there is no need to have a special meeting on this. It will be taken when the Board of Directors meets anyway. But this is a legal, formal requirement that we have to do; the political authorisation happened today.
",https://www.esm.europa.eu/press-releases/transcript-eurogroup-press-conference
Klaus Regling,11.07.2016,"On Greece, you’ve heard about the progress the country is making, therefore the ESM is able to continue to disburse the corresponding tranches; the last disbursement happened two weeks ago, on 26 October, €2.8 billion. With that disbursement, we have now under the current programme disbursed €31.7 billion out of the up to €86 billion. And when you look at the combined EFSF and ESM, what we have done in the last five years, our loans to Greece amount to €173 billion, and that of course makes us by far the largest creditor of the country.
A few words on the short-term debt measures for Greece that the Chairman already referred to; you remember that the Eurogroup in May asked the ESM to look into these short-term measures. Three are mentioned in the statement of 25 May that you all know: smoothening the repayment profile under the current average maturity, second, use the funding strategy to reduce interest rate risk for Greece, and finally, waive the step-up interest rate margin for 2017. I will present proposals to the Eurogroup in December; we are still working on it, therefore it’s still too early to talk about any details. But we have made good progress in these three areas. It’s important as a reminder that some of these measures mean there could be additional costs upfront before one can have benefits later on. For example, if one has an interest rate swap – swapping shorter-term rates for longer-term rates. The costs go up in the short run, but there are savings in the longer term. But I’m optimistic that overall we can find solutions that will really have a visible positive impact on Greek debt sustainability.
On Cyprus, as mentioned, the ESM also took part in this first post-programme review. I share what the Commissioner [Moscovici] has said. I was also in Cyprus last week and could first-hand see how the country has changed. And I also heard the commitments from the finance minister and the president to continue with structural reforms, although there is a difficult situation in parliament, not a clear majority, and also importantly, to continue with a sound fiscal policy, and I believe this is particularly important to prepare for the possible unification. And the last point on Cyprus: it’s important to recognise that two of the three largest rating agencies have upgraded Cyprus in the last few weeks, so they also recognise the significant progress that one can see.
On Spain, there was a joint mission with the Commission and the ECB, and I don’t need to go into those details, but one word on the early repayment. Spain requested another early repayment of €1 billion to the ESM. That had to be approved by the Board of Directors, which happened last week. And with this fourth repayment, the overall loan of the ESM to Spain has been reduced from initially €41.3 billion to now €34.7 billion. I think it’s a good sign; it shows that the programme worked well, it demonstrates that Spain has good access to markets. And it’s also a positive sign because it increases the remaining lending capacity of the ESM, as we get money back early on. Of course it has an impact on our funding activities; because our claims are reduced, we also need to reduce our liabilities by the same amount. And that early repayment from Spain therefore reduces our funding needs for this year by €1 billion. We are able to do that and we only have €1 billion left in funding needs this year after this repayment, and that will happen through a tap auction next Wednesday as was announced this morning.
For next year, the EFSF and ESM plan again to issue €50 billion in bonds, so we will continue to be a major issuer in the euro market.
Response to question comparing Portugal and Greece
Just to confirm that when you look at the 10-year market secondary yield for Portuguese government debt, it’s around 3.5%, for Greece it’s around 8%, so it shows exactly this point that they are in a completely different situation.
Response to question on short-term debt relief measures for Greece
The mandate was to reduce interest rate vulnerability of Greece. As I said, there can be short-term costs in order to get longer-term gains. There are different ways to do that, we are looking into that, nothing is decided, so I cannot tell you any details right now, maybe in a month. But I will present proposals to that respect to the Eurogroup next month.
",https://www.esm.europa.eu/press-releases/transcript-eurogroup-press-conference-0
Klaus Regling,12.05.2016,"Good evening, let me say a few words about the short-term debt relief measures that I presented to the ministers this evening, and as you heard from the Chairman of the Eurogroup, the ministers endorsed these measures, so we will start implementing them over the next few weeks, and then implementation itself will take a while.
I realise that I don’t have to have to go into many details because you all know the paper that the ESM drafted on this, which was leaked, which I regret. But still, let me highlight a few points. Following the mandate the ESM received earlier this year, we put together proposals that we believe are workable. And I think that together, they are an important step to improve Greek debt sustainability. When we have implemented all these measures, they could lead to a cumulative reduction of the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio of around 20 percentage points over the time horizon until 2060. And looking at the so-called gross financing side, the measure that the Eurogroup accepted as a benchmark for assessing debt sustainability, the cumulative positive impact of these short-term measures is that by 2060 the GFN (gross financing needs) would be almost 5 percentage points lower.
Of course, this time horizon until 2060 is unusually long and implies great uncertainty. Therefore one has to be very careful that these are estimates – our best estimates at the moment. But there is a high degree of uncertainty, market conditions can change, and therefore this has to be preliminary. But very clearly, together these measures will improve Greek debt sustainability.
Looking at the proposals a little bit in more detail, there are three sets of short-term measures that we proposed and which are in line with the May Eurogroup statement. The first set is about smoothing of the repayment profile for Greece - this is related to Greece’s second programme, which was an EFSF programme. The weighted average maturity of these loans today is 28 years, and this can be brought up to 32.5 years. And as a consequence, repayment humps which existed in the 2030s and 2040s – and could have been a challenge for Greece if nothing had been changed – these humps will now be spread out and there will be a smoother profile for Greece to repay its debt.
The second set of measures is about reducing the interest rate risk for Greece, and there are three different schemes for that second measure. The first is a bond exchange to recapitalise Greek banks. The EFSF and ESM provided loans to Greece for €42 billion. These loans were not disbursed in cash, but in the form of floating-rate notes, as we also did in other countries, such as Spain and Cyprus, it’s a normal process. These notes will now be exchanged for fixed-rate bonds with a much longer maturity. And because the new bonds will be at fixed rates, Greece no longer bears the risk that interest rates will go up. Of course it also means that upfront there may be costs because from the beginning then, Greece has to pay a higher long-term rate, but we are very certain that over time, in the longer run, there will be substantial savings.
The second scheme foresees that the ESM would enter into swap arrangements. This would stabilise the ESM’s overall cost of funding and thereby also reduce the risk that Greece would have to pay high interest rates on its loans if and when rates in financial markets start rising.
 
 The third scheme, known as matched funding, foresees that the ESM will finance future disbursements to Greece with long-term notes, and therefore this will also stabilise the interest rate cost. This entails issuing long-term bonds that closely match the maturity of the Greek loans. Market conditions may influence the degree to which these measures to reduce interest rate risk can be applied. And the implementation phase will be 12 – 18 months. Finally, there is the third measure in our proposal, the waiver of the step-up interest rate margin. This is related to a tranche of €11.3 billion of the EFSF programme (the so-called second programme) that was used to finance debt buy-backs. On this particular tranche, if nothing happens, there would be a margin of 200 basis points, and that will be waived for the year 2017.
You may ask what are the costs of all these measures – the benefits I talked about, the benefits for Greece are clear. Also we cannot be very precise on the quantification, but the direction is clear that it will improve debt sustainability. Are there costs for the ESM or member states? They are very limited. The cancellation of the step-up interest rate of 200 basis points will save €200 million – that is income that member states are giving up. Otherwise, all costs from the implementation of the different schemes I talked about will be borne by Greece, so that relates to interest rate swaps, where there are costs upfront and savings later. There are no budgetary implications for the ESM member states, so it’s not a change in the existing programme in that sense. And for Greece, as I said already, whatever short-term costs there are, have to be borne, but they will be more than compensated by the longer-term benefits.
I think that’s what I wanted to say on the programme. It will only have a marginal impact on our funding policy, on EFSF and ESM funding for 2017. We will communicate these changes very soon to the markets, because we always do that well in advance before we start the new year. And if you wonder, we will not stop issuing shorter maturities, even though we have a focus now on longer maturities. We will remain present as an issuer in benchmark size along the entire yield curve, also in the future.
 
Response to question on Greece’s projected debt-to-GDP ratio in 2060
I cannot give you a precise number on that, because for that, we need to agree on the fiscal path, and there are different scenarios. We have our baseline scenario, which we, together with the Commission and the ECB, believe in. But we know there also other scenarios, and given that the time-frame is very, very long, we know that uncertainty is high and nobody can say that one scenario is certainly right and the other is certainly wrong. So I would be reluctant to give you a number. But it’s safer to say what is the positive impact from whatever scenario you start from, that’s how we got to the 20 percentage points [reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2060 thanks to the EFSF/ESM short-term debt-relief measures].
",https://www.esm.europa.eu/press-releases/transcript-eurogroup-press-conference-greece
Klaus Regling,01.26.2017,"A few words from the ESM perspective. First, on the Greek short-term debt measures. I think you are probably aware that earlier this week, the Board of Directors of the EFSF and ESM adopted the necessary legal decisions to start implementation of these short-term measures. I think it’s really important for Greece because it will reduce interest rate risk and improve Greek debt sustainability. You are probably familiar with the details; you can read them on the ESM website. Just a short reminder: we are dealing here with a bond exchange, where floating rate notes disbursed by the ESM and EFSF to Greece for bank recapitalisation will be exchanged for fixed coupon notes. There are measures related to swap arrangements that will reduce the risk that Greece will have to pay a higher interest rate on its loans when market rates go up. We will do matched funding, which essentially means issuing long-term bonds to match the long maturity of our loans to Greece. In addition, the EFSF waived the step-up interest rate margin for the year 2017 on a particular loan tranche. A margin of 2% had originally been foreseen, to be paid from 2017 on. And we are adapting the maturities of our outstanding loans. All this will go a long way in easing the debt burden for Greece over time, according to our debt sustainability analysis. It could lead to a cumulative reduction of the Greek debt to GDP ratio of around 20 percentage points over the time horizon until 2060. It will also produce a cumulative relief effect of around 5 percentage points of gross financing needs.
It’s important to note that in line with the mandate we received last May from the Eurogroup, all this happens without budgetary implications for ESM Member States. With these short-term debt measures, we are improving the debt conditions for Greece and I think this will also contribute to the return of Greece to market financing over time. Of course, the success of the programme lies in the continued implementation of reforms as agreed, and in that context, the conclusion of the second review is important.
On Ireland and Portugal, Chairman Dijsselbloem and Commissioner Moscovici talked about the post-programme monitoring missions that took place. As always, the ESM participates in these surveillance missions in the context of our Early Warning System. It is designed so that we are confident that former programme countries are able to honour their interest and repayment obligations to the EFSF and ESM. For both countries, we do not see repayment risks. Of course, the two countries are in very different positions from the market perspective – when you compare the interest rates for Ireland and Portugal, Ireland benefits from very favourable market perceptions, while Portugal, we have to realize that markets are nervous about a number of things: about the debt level, the financial sector, and also the competitiveness of the economy. But I’m confident, and the minister talked about that, if they address these issues, also markets will react to positively to that.
Finally, a few words on the funding activities of the EFSF and ESM. It’s always important from my perspective, because we have to find the money first before we can give loans or refinance outstanding claims. We announced to markets some time ago that this year, in 2017, we intend to issue bonds amounting to €57 billion, and this week the ESM was in the market for the first time this year with a very successful deal. We raised €3.5 billion by issuing a 30-year bond. It was the first 30-year deal of this size in our segment of the market this year. And it was the largest in this segment of the market since 2014. The issue was two times oversubscribed, although there was a lot of supply from other issuers in the same week. And it shows that we meet investor needs in terms of timing and maturity, it shows there is ongoing demand from high quality investors like pension funds and insurance companies for our papers.
 
Question on whether there was any feedback from the IMF regarding the impact of short-term debt relief measures, and whether it will be enough for the IMF to participate in the programme
Of course the IMF is fully informed, and I mentioned already in my introduction here tonight that over time, these measures, from today’s perspective (because it always depends on the market situation) we will reduce the debt stock in terms of GDP by 20 percentage points and the gross financing needs by 5 percentage points. That’s important, but to be fair, I don’t think this is enough for the IMF, from their perspective today, to say now everything is done and we don’t look for further debt measures. I don’t think that is their view. But they are fully informed and they will incorporate that in their own debt sustainability analysis.
",https://www.esm.europa.eu/press-releases/klaus-reglings-remarks-eurogroup-press-conference
Klaus Regling,02.20.2017,"Thank you very much. Indeed, I’m very happy to continue as the boss of the ESM. I’m grateful that the finance ministers reappointed me for another term. When I started the first term in 2012, to think back how Europe looked like in 2012, at that point in time I already had two and a half years’ experience with the EFSF. And the ESM was really a new institution that was not foreseen in the initial design of monetary union.  The ESM is now our lender of last resort to sovereigns, and I think it’s fair to say today that without the creation of the EFSF and ESM, some Member States would have probably been forced to leave the euro area. And I think Europe would be a different place today if that had happened.
It’s also very satisfying to see that former programme countries are so successful. Four of the five countries that received financial assistance from the EFSF and ESM exited their programmes; they are able to refinance themselves on the markets fully. It shows that our “cash for reforms” approach indeed works. These four countries out of the five that have exited – they have growth rates today that are among the highest in Europe, so it’s really successful. Greece is the only country that is still in an active programme, it’s a special case as I have said on many occasions. Therefore, it’s very good that there is now a common understanding for the four institutions to go back to Athens. Indeed, as Chairman Dijsselbloem and Commissioner Moscovici said, it’s important to come to an agreement soon. We know the big repayment is only due in July, but in the meanwhile, it would have a positive impact on confidence if we can conclude soon. And also the Greek authorities could then continue to repay their domestic arrears, as they successfully did last year. And we know that stimulates growth and employment. So that’s why it’s important to work on this and we are certainly determined to do that.
One other element: we had good news from Greece today. They have repaid to the ESM €2 billion; you may ask why they are repaying any money to us while at the same time we are talking about concluding a review which leads to more disbursements. It has to do with the bank recapitalisation that took place in 2015. At that time, we disbursed €5.4 billion to the Greek government, which in turn was earmarked and used to recapitalise two banks as part of the restructuring agreement that was agreed with DG [Directorate General of the European Commission] Competition. It was agreed that the National Bank of Greece would have to sell its subsidiary, and the proceeds of that sale would be used to repay the ESM. So this has happened, and that’s why, in line with our financing and lending agreement, Greece indeed repaid €2 billion to us. I think that’s positive; it shows that what we agree with Greece happens, and it happened on time. It’s also good because it reduces Greek debt by €2 billion, and at the same time increases the lending capacity of the ESM, which is also good for the stability of the euro area. So that’s good news – let me leave it at that.
",https://www.esm.europa.eu/press-releases/transcript-k-reglings-remarks-eurogroup-press-conference
Klaus Regling,03.20.2017,"Just a few words on Greece from the ESM perspective. I share the assessment that there has been good progress since the last meeting of the Eurogroup, particularly when the mission and the four institutions were in Athens. But it’s also clear that a significant number of issues are not resolved yet. And there is a risk indeed that this might have a negative impact on the economy, on confidence of consumers, on domestic and foreign investors. And therefore it is important to intensify the work. If one looks at this in a wider context, we should remember that since the programme started in August 2015, we have seen good progress. The ESM was able to disburse €31 billion to Greece since September 2015. Of course, always linked to programme implementation, and one could see the positive impact of that on the economy last year, when growth accelerated and we saw positive fiscal performance.
 
We should really try everything to maintain this momentum, because as I said, the uncertainty about the conclusion of the review may be costly. We know that the next big debt service payment from Greece is only due in July, but it would be much better to conclude the review well before that in order to stabilise economic developments, and therefore that’s the reason why Chairman Dijsselbloem announced that work will intensify in the next few days here in Brussels between the institutions and the Greek authorities.
 
Response to question on proposals to develop the ESM into a European monetary fund
There was one important point that I think I can say on behalf of all of you, which was not mentioned to avoid misunderstanding: nobody is advocating changing the institutional set-up now. For the Greek case in particular, we are all in favour of getting the IMF on board, so there is no misunderstanding. Otherwise, you can understand that I read and hear these proposals with great interest; it’s not completely new, and the European Parliament debated already the question of a European monetary fund coming out of the ESM in 2014; I was at a meeting of the ECON committee at the time. I think it’s becoming a bit more concrete now and there seems to be – for the future, not for the current programme – a growing opinion that this would make sense.
The ESM indeed as you said has developed over the last few years. We are much more involved in the programmes than we were five years ago. We are now in all the review missions, we have our own  so-called Early Warning System to do the post-programme monitoring, and that makes sense because we are in some cases the largest creditor of a country; we are the largest public creditor in all cases, so we must take a view – we want to be repaid one day. Therefore we are very interested in the economic and fiscal developments of each of the five countries that borrowed from us. We are also developing in the sense that we will have an evaluation report on the work of the ESM over the last few years that will be made public at our annual meeting in June. We are working on that and there will also be some conclusions drawn from that. So I think this debate will be interesting; I don’t expect quick results, because it would require changing the ESM Treaty – that is possible, but it requires consensus of our 19 Member States, and it will take a while before that is reached.
 
 
Response to question on Greece requesting a loan from the World Bank
It was not an issue today; I know you would like to write about it. World Bank loans are not that unusual for countries that borrow from the IMF, for instance; it often goes in parallel. Of course, it can have an impact and would have an impact on debt sustainability, on the fiscal targets, therefore we need to be well-informed. I sent a letter to minister Tsakalotos to ask for details – not to discourage him, but we need to be aware of the details. In that sense, we are very interested, but it’s not something that will distract us from our work.

Klaus Regling,04.07.2017,"But of course, Greece was important and I share the view that you already heard. I welcome the agreement on the broad overarching policy issues. And I think that puts us back on a good path to complete the work and to conclude the review. You also heard about the overperformance of Greece, of the economy, the fiscal side in 2016; we will get the final numbers in about two weeks. We tend to talk about primary surpluses these days, but I think in other countries, people look more at the overall fiscal balance, and if the numbers we see so far in Greece are confirmed for 2016, we may well see a fiscal surplus, or a ‘black zero’, as it’s called in some countries. And I think that would be a remarkable achievement.
On Cyprus, the ESM participated also in the post-programme missions, together with the other institutions. We broadly share the conclusions on the positive developments, which are clearly demonstrating that the ESM programme for Cyprus worked well. There are also medium-term challenges. What is also encouraging is that financial markets have recognised these positive developments: the yields on public Cypriot debt have been coming down more than in other countries. The spread with Germany has narrowed more than for any other country in the recent months. And one of the rating agencies upgraded Cyprus to BB+, which is one notch below investment grade. So also that is positive in itself, and helps the financing conditions in Cyprus.

Klaus Regling,05.23.2017,"There was progress, and I think it’s really good for the Greek economy that there was agreement on the policy package because this can put Greece on a stronger growth path. And that was appreciated by all ministers. It also means we do have a shared conditionality among all the four institutions, which took a while to get there, but we reached that point.
 Obviously, we will continue to work on the debt measures on the basis of the May 2016 statement. At the ESM, we are ready to make disbursements as soon as we have reached full agreement. There is some time left to work on this, but not very much, because you all know that some debt service payments are coming up in July.
Although we didn’t have the full agreement on debt relief measures tonight, let me remind you that we are not starting from scratch here. In 2012, Greece already received unparalleled debt relief from both private and official creditors. Private creditors accepted the largest nominal haircut in history, and the official side provided maturity extension, interest deferral, and reduction in fees and margins. And that added up to another NPV (net present value) reduction of around 40%. So we are working with this behind us already, and there is a good basis on top of that, as you know, since early this year at the ESM we are implementing the short-term debt measures that were already agreed by the Eurogroup in May last year.

Klaus Regling,06.12.2017,"A few words on Greece from the ESM perspective. Of course, I’m also happy that the second review was concluded today, although we have to remember that parliamentary procedures are necessary in a number of countries. This second review includes an impressive policy package, and a long list of prior actions that  the Greek government and parliament have implemented. And these policy conditions are supported by all the institutions. Let me also remind you that these policy commitments and prior actions come on top of what has happened in the last few years, and I find it impressive that Greece was one of the few European countries that had a fiscal surplus last year.
I’m also happy that the Eurogroup reached agreement on the medium-term debt measures, on the basis of the May 2016 Eurogroup declaration. By providing further clarity on the debt measures that may be adopted at the end of the programme, the European partners show how serious they are in their continuous support for Greece.
Let me explain briefly what are the next steps and how the third tranche from the ESM will be used. It was agreed that the third tranche of the ESM loan will amount to €8.5 billion. This amount will cover Greece’s external debt repayment obligations in the next months, and arrears clearance for the next quarter. The first disbursement of this third tranche is expected to take place in the beginning of July, after national procedures have been completed, and will amount to €7.7 billion. Of this amount, €6.9 billion should be used for debt servicing, and the remaining €0.8 billion for arrears clearance. There will be another arrears clearance disbursement in the amount of €0.8 billion – that is expected to take place after the summer, under the condition that Greece has contributed with its own resources to the arrears clearance effort.
Let me remind you that since the beginning of the programme in August 2015, the ESM has already disbursed €31.7 billion to Greece, out of a total programme volume of up to €86 billion. Adding the EFSF loans from the previous programme, you get to a total of €173 billion. Once we have disbursed this new tranche in the next few weeks, we will have more than 50% of the Greek public debt in our books. This number shows that we are by far the largest creditor of Greece. And it makes clear how much Greece can benefit and does benefit from our loans. In 2016 alone, the Greek budget saved 5.6% of GDP, that is €9.9 billion euros due to our low interest rates and favourable lending terms. By the way, you’ll find these numbers in the ESM Annual Report that was adopted by our Governors earlier today.
 
Response to question on period that ESM disbursement covers
Well, as I said, the €8.5 billion that was endorsed today will cover the big debt service payments due in July and that you all know about, and will also allow domestic debt arrears clearance over the next few months. We know that after that, the debt service payments for the rest of the year are relatively small, and at the same time of course, Greece will have a primary surplus, which means, excluding debt service payments, Greece will month after month accumulate cash that can either be used to build up a cash buffer, to do additional arrears clearance, or to cover smaller debt service payments. So we are confident that the liquidity situation will be good enough until about the end of this year.

Klaus Regling,07.10.2017,"Let me start with Greece, which was not on the agenda, and if I remember correctly, it was the first time this year it was not on the agenda of a Eurogroup. So that in itself is a good sign. But I just wanted to add to what Commissioner Moscovici said that today, the ESM disbursed €7.7 billion to Greece, and indeed the money arrived in Athens this afternoon. This follows the Board of Directors’ meeting on Friday. The Commissioner mentioned that the overall tranche is €8.5 billion, and that means another €0.8 billion can be disbursed after September 1. That money is fully earmarked for arrears clearance, and will only become available if the agreed arrears clearance scheme has been put in place. We all know that paying and clearing arrears is really important for the functioning of the economy.
With this disbursement today, the ESM has already disbursed €39.4 billion to Greece out of a total programme volume of up to €86 billion. Adding the previous EFSF loans to this amount, we come to a total of €181 billion. With this disbursement, the ESM/EFSF together now have over 51% of the Greek public debt in our books. That makes us Greece’s biggest creditor, and given the long maturities of our loans, it also shows that we will be a long-term partner to Greece. It also underlines the commitment and solidarity of the euro area in support of Greece’s economic recovery.
My second point is on Ireland, where the ESM also participated in the post-programme surveillance mission. I agree with the assessment of the Commission: Ireland’s economic success in the last few years is remarkable. Ireland is perhaps the best example of a successful adjustment programme. Ireland received €17.7 billion from the EFSF between 2011 and 2013 but it will only start repaying the principal by 2029, of course in the meanwhile there are interest and fees to be paid.
We have no concerns about Ireland’s capacity to honour its debt in the short term. But given the long maturities and beyond the short term, there are some areas where Ireland could prepare for the future, and we know the future is always uncertain. For a small open economy like Ireland, the need to maintain significant fiscal buffers should not be underestimated, as it is critical to protect from any potential external shocks. And in addition, the repair of the banks’ balance sheets, which has started in an impressive way, should continue and be completed through a further reduction in non-performing loans.
 
Response to question on the timing of Greece’s potential return to the markets
As you know, our programme with Greece ends next year in August, but it is a good moment to think about it. When I was in Athens 10 days ago, this topic came up in all my meetings with the authorities. Greece has been absent from the markets for quite a while. There were two bonds issued in 2014, but otherwise, not since 2009. Therefore, it is important for Greece to develop a strategy to go back. We know from the other countries that successfully exited their programmes – Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus – that they went to the market well before the end of their programme. Because it would not be wise to rely on the ESM to the last day of the programme, and then from the next day, a hundred percent on the market. That would not be good.
But it is important to have a good strategy to communicate with markets, so that markets understand it is not a one-off step that is taken; they want to see how it continues in the future. And also markets want to be reassured that reforms continue. Of course, the disbursement today is a sign that we concluded the second review, that there is good cooperation, but it must continue during the remainder of the programme – that’s important for investors, I hear that whenever I talk to them. So that should also be kept in mind by the Greek authorities.
And the last point: it’s important to remember that Greece will not need that much money from the markets in the future. There was an overall fiscal surplus last year; it will dip a bit, but there will be a primary surplus, and we agreed over the last few years, and it was confirmed in the last Eurogroup in June that there will be a primary surplus – first 3.5% and at least 2% for the long run. And that means Greece does not need to go to the market to finance a fiscal deficit. That was completely different 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago, where big amounts of money were needed to finance the fiscal deficit. The money that is needed in the future is to roll over existing debt that matures, and that’s a very different story from the past. That’s the result of the fiscal consolidation we have seen.
