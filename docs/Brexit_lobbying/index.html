Sharp increase of British financial lobbying ahead of Brexit.</div>

<p>As the key players of the Brexit talks prepare for an eventful September, London goes to the offensive, as more British financial lobbyists register for access to the EU in 2017 than ever, vying to influence decision making ahead of Brexit talks.</p>

<p>Lobbying and the influencing of policy making is not news in Brussels. The European Union's transparency register includes all organizations which have been granted permission to enter the European Institutions and interact with stakeholders on a daily basis. </p>

<p>The register of course is not comprehensive enough to list every meal, coffee, or drink European officials have had with professionals outside the Berlaymont, but it does identify all entities which have been granted clearance to enter the Institutions, along with information such as where their head office is situated, their size, type, and interest field.</p>
      
      <div id="my_another_subheader">
        What changed after the Brexit referendum?
      </div>

<p>We examined the transparency register, from 2008 until present, in order to identify the increase of new additions to the register, pre and post Brexit.</p>

<p>We performed separate investigations about new additions from the UK, and from Germany, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands, all which have an interest in absorbing finance related jobs from post Brexit City. We determined its size based on the sum of persons involved, and accounted for finance related interests. </p>
