Brexit talks mean more financial lobbying than ever in Brussels.</div>

<i>Data analysis and text by Ioannis Antypas, August 2017</i>
</div>

<p>As the key players of the Brexit talks prepare for the arduous negotiations commencing this week, London is on the move to influence Brussels. In 2017 there will be more finance related lobbying from the U.K. than ever before, as a new wave of lobbyists and policy experts vye to influence decision making.</p>

<p>Lobbying and the influencing of policy making is not news in Brussels. The European Union's transparency register includes all organizations which have been granted permission to enter the European Institutions and interact with stakeholders on a daily basis. </p>

<p>We examined the register, from 2008 until present, seeking to examine how has lobbying in Brussels evolved over the years, and what is the picture today, more than a year after the Brexit referendum which shocked the European Union to its core.</p>

<p>We performed separate investigations about lobbying from the U.K. and from Germany, France, Ireland, and the Netherlands, all of which have an interest in absorbing finance related jobs from post Brexit City. The register of course is not comprehensive enough to list every meal, coffee, or drink European officials have had with professionals outside the Berlaymont, but it does identify all entities which have been granted clearance to enter the Institutions, along with information such as where their head office is situated, their size, and interest field.</p>

        London on the offensive? 
      </div>


<p>Between 2016 and 2017, the rate of new additions to the EU's transparency register declaring that they have financial related interests has increased by 155%. After the turmoulous events of 2016, and the disastrous snap elections in June, further increasing political uncertainty in London, demand for finance-savvy lobbyists seems to be at an all time high.</p>

</div>



<p>More specifically, in 2016 London lagged behind Frankfurt and Berlin in terms of financial lobbying, its spectacular increase in less than a year though has overturned this reality.</p>

<p>That does not mean that competing cities sit by idly watching London try to navigate the European institutional maze to its benefit. Frankfurt in particular has been relentless in its pursuit to influence as many bank business quitting London. Paris, Amsterdam, and Dublin all following suit.</p>


<p>There is a very real possibility that in post Brexit London, financial firms and banks would have to forgo the so-called "passporting" rules that allow pan-European selling of financial services. This fear has led to many financial firms drafting contingency plans, including the relocation of thousands of jobs to continental Europe.</p>



<div id="my_another_subheader">The evolution of lobbying in Brussels over the years.</div>

<p>Never before has there been such a busy time for lobbyists in Brussels. Navigating through the multiple conferences held every day around the Parliament, sipping coffee at EKXI with European officials or meeting with Commissioners in the Berlaymont, Brussels is rapidly becoming lobbying boom-town. </p>

</div>


<p>The aftershocks of the Brexit referendum have certainly precipitated the evolution of this trend, however it is not the only crisis plaguing the European Union. Between Greece coming close to exiting the Eurozone in 2015, and Europe facing an existential crisis in 2016 as skepticism towards its migration management almost brought to power the most ardent of anti-Europeanists, the European Union has survived, albeit wounded. </p>


<p>Such seismic events shake up the status quo, force the hand of policy makers to opt for change and reform, and present enticing opportunities for those who able to influence it. </p>
