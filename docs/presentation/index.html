<p>The <strong>Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA),</strong> as part of the Association Agreement, entered into force on 1 September 2017, having been provisionally applied since 1 January 2016. This constitutes a major milestone in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/ukraine/">bilateral trade relations</a> and offers new economic opportunities to both the EU and Ukraine. Ukrainian businesses receive <strong>stable and predictable preferential access to the largest market in the world</strong>, with over 500 million consumers. While EU businesses are able to benefit from easier access to the Ukrainian market and build new relationships with Ukrainian suppliers and partners. The EU is reinforcing its position as Ukraine's number one trading partner. Exports from Ukraine to the EU and Ukrainian imports from the EU both increased by about 27% in the first eight months of 2017 compared to the same period the previous year.  </p>

<p>The agreement triggers a reform of Ukraine's legal framework, with the aim of aligning it with that of the EU's (the EU <em>acquis</em>) and, in the long-term, to treat many Ukrainian products the same way as others, which are traded within the EU internal market. Given the gradual adoption by Ukraine of EU laws and internationally-recognised EU standards in production and services, Ukraine should be able to <strong>export more easily</strong> not only to the EU, but also to the rest of the world â€“ including to Ukraine's traditional markets. In addition the reforms that are anchored in the DCFTA will <strong>improve the overall business climate </strong>in Ukraine, including <strong>curbing corruption</strong>, which will in turn <strong>increase investor confidence</strong>.</p>

<p>EU investors and businesses in Ukraine will contribute to the transfer of new technologies and management methods that will improve the efficiency and quality of Ukrainian production and business governance.  Upgrading production technologies will reduce the production costs for Ukrainian businesses, enabling them to compete with EU-based firms.</p>

<p>Ukraine has an opportunity to diversify its economy, which is based today on large companies in basic commodity sectors (e.g. metallurgy), moving towards a more modern model including the development of a vibrant services sector and many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

<p>Furthermore, a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on temporary "Autonomous Trade Measures" for Ukraine <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1730">entered into force on 1 October 2017</a>, topping up the quantities of agricultural products Ukraine can export to the EU under the AA/DCFTA without paying customs duties and accelerating the elimination of customs tariffs for several industrial products foreseen in the Agreement. This should further boost Ukrainian exports to the EU and counter the effect of Russia's restrictive measures against Ukraine. </p>
