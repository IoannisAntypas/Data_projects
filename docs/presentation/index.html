<div id= 'my_header'>Ioannis Antypas - Data visualization for StratCom</div>

<p></p>

<p>My name is Ioannis Antypas, I am a Greek data journalist in Brussels. I have been reporting from the EU Institutions for the past 6 years, and during the summer of 2017 I attended the Lede program of Columbia University in New York, teaching coding to journalists. I believe that a factual, data-based approach is key to navigating today's communication and media cacophony, where a myriad of claims and counterclaims, accidentally or intentionally, often reach the boundaries of conspiracy theory.</p>

<p> In this page you will find three different approaches to using data visualization to enhance the messages of StratCom. Complementing the text by adding a visualization to empower the narrative, then replacing text to focus the  attention of the reader to a figure rather than text, and lastly, using coding techniques such as web scraping to obtain data and then visualize them in a way that generates a new story to the existing narrative.</p>

<div id="my_another_subheader">Trade</div>

<p></p>
<p>The <strong>Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA),</strong> as part of the Association Agreement, entered into force on 1 September 2017, having been provisionally applied since 1 January 2016. This constitutes a major milestone in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/ukraine/">bilateral trade relations</a> and offers new economic opportunities to both the EU and Ukraine. Ukrainian businesses receive <strong>stable and predictable preferential access to the largest market in the world</strong>, with over 500 million consumers. While EU businesses are able to benefit from easier access to the Ukrainian market and build new relationships with Ukrainian suppliers and partners. The EU is reinforcing its position as Ukraine's number one trading partner. Exports from Ukraine to the EU and Ukrainian imports from the EU both increased by about 27% in the first eight months of 2017 compared to the same period the previous year.  </p>

<p>The agreement triggers a reform of Ukraine's legal framework, with the aim of aligning it with that of the EU's (the EU <em>acquis</em>) and, in the long-term, to treat many Ukrainian products the same way as others, which are traded within the EU internal market. Given the gradual adoption by Ukraine of EU laws and internationally-recognised EU standards in production and services, Ukraine should be able to <strong>export more easily</strong> not only to the EU, but also to the rest of the world – including to Ukraine's traditional markets. In addition the reforms that are anchored in the DCFTA will <strong>improve the overall business climate </strong>in Ukraine, including <strong>curbing corruption</strong>, which will in turn <strong>increase investor confidence</strong>.</p>

<p>EU investors and businesses in Ukraine will contribute to the transfer of new technologies and management methods that will improve the efficiency and quality of Ukrainian production and business governance.  Upgrading production technologies will reduce the production costs for Ukrainian businesses, enabling them to compete with EU-based firms.</p>

<p>Ukraine has an opportunity to diversify its economy, which is based today on large companies in basic commodity sectors (e.g. metallurgy), moving towards a more modern model including the development of a vibrant services sector and many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

<p>Furthermore, a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on temporary "Autonomous Trade Measures" for Ukraine <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1730">entered into force on 1 October 2017</a>, topping up the quantities of agricultural products Ukraine can export to the EU under the AA/DCFTA without paying customs duties and accelerating the elimination of customs tariffs for several industrial products foreseen in the Agreement. This should further boost Ukrainian exports to the EU and counter the effect of Russia's restrictive measures against Ukraine. </p>

<div id="my_another_subheader">Reforms</div>


<p>Since spring 2014, Ukraine has embarked on an <strong>ambitious reform timetable</strong> aiming to stabilise its economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. Ukraine and the EU have jointly defined a reform agenda (the <strong>Association Agenda</strong>, which was last updated in March 2015) and follow the progress of this closely. The fight against corruption, reforming the judiciary, constitutional and electoral reforms, the improvement of the business climate and energy efficiency, as well as reform of public administration, including decentralisation, are among the top priorities on the agenda. Gender mainstreaming is a priority in all sectors.</p>

<p>In addition to political support, the EU has pledged a <strong>€12.8 billion support package</strong> for the next few years to support the reform process.</p>

<div id="my_another_subheader">Sanctions</div>

<p>The European Council of 20 March 2014 <strong>strongly condemned the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation</strong>. EU leaders underlined that there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century. The EU does not and will not recognise the illegal annexation. The EU has adopted a strict <strong>non-recognition policy</strong> with regard to the illegal annexation. This policy has led to substantive sanctions, set out in the annex to this Factsheet. The sanctions have been extended several times since then and are still in place (see annex).</p>

<div id= "my_image_caption"> Data found in https://sanctionsmap.eu</div>

<p></p>
<p> The most common profile of those sanctioned by the EU is <strong>a male physical person, undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. </strong>Their background is either <strong>unknown</strong> or most commonly they act <strong> in an international setting</strong>, having ties with multiple countries. The most common sanctions are asset freezes and prohibition to make funds available, but they are also restricted from being admitted to EU Member States, and financial measures are taken, targeting investments, and restrictions on goods and services.
