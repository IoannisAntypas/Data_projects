# Hi, I'm Ioannis

I am a data journalist from Athens, Greece, living in Brussels, and reporting on all things European Union. Here you may find some of the projects I worked at during the [Lede Program](http://ledeprogram.com) in summer 2017 in Columbia University.

* [More persons than ever involved in British financial lobbies.]({{ site.url }}/Brexit_lobbying)
* [Are we seriously facing the return of extinct diseases?]({{ site.url }}/Anti_vaxinations_a_ticking_time_bomb/)
* [Did you know Eurovision (yes that contest) is a playground of data?]({{ site.url }}/Eurovision_map)
* [Apparently the Eurogroup is not the most sentimental place.]({{ site.url }}/sentiment_analysis)
* [Poverty in Greek children grew more than in any other EU country.(Might be all Greek to you)](http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/736025/eurostat-ragdaia-auxisi-tis-paidiki-ftoheias-stin-ellada-)
